Cabinet decided to-day to authorize the Repatriation Commission<br>
to extend its functions for the establishment of courses of training cr<br>
other measures to serve the necessities of treatment. The commission<br>
will be authorized to-<br>

ACTING MINISTERS.<br>
On 3rd July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) will be Acting Prime Minister<br>
and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) will be<br>
. cting Treasurer during my absence overseas.""<br>
On 21st July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) is leaving Australia<br>
on the first stage of his journey overseas on 22nd July, 1948. I will act<br>
as Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Health and<br>
Social Services ( Senator McKenna) will act as Attorney-General as<br>
from 23rd July and for the period of Dr. Evatt's absence abroad.""<br>
PEACE.<br>
GERMANY-BERLIN POSITION.<br>
On 6th July, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)<br>
said that following the cutting off by the Soviet authorities of all surface<br>
methods of-supplying Allied occupation forces and the German population<br>
in the three western sectors of Berlin, the British, United States<br>
and French Governments, in their determined employment of emergency<br>
supply measures, were protecting their undoubted juridical rights.<br>
4738.-2. </p>
<p>The presence of occupation forces in Berlin was clearly authorize'd<br>
by the agreement of 1944 nominating Berlin as the centre of Allied<br>
control of Germany and setting up machinery for Allied government<br>
of the city. The agreement had been subsequently amended to provide<br>
for the participation of France and had been made public in joint<br>
four-power statements issued with the declaration on the surrender of<br>
Germany, on 5th June, 1945. The agreement became operative before<br>
the Potsdam Agreement, so that the Soviet contention that the western<br>
powers have brought four-power control to an end by violating thr.<br>
Potsdam Agreement was clearly inadmissible. In the interests of world<br>
peace, it was hoped that all outstanding matters affecting Berlin would<br>
soon be discussed between the western powers and the Soviet Union,<br>
but no permanent easing of tension could result unless the Soviet Union<br>
recognized clearly and unequivocally the undoubted occupation rights of<br>
the western Allies. These had been hardly won in the common struggle<br>
against Hitler and could not be set aside or nullified by unilateral acts.<br>
On llth July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-<br>
It is unthinkable that the western Allies should do other than hold<br>
on in Berlin. There is no question that Australia supports the westerii<br>
Allies."" On 18th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
I went to Berlin to gather some real background information of the<br>
position. The British Foreign Secretary ( Mr. Bevin) thought it<br>
highly desirable for me to get the atmosphere of the position and to<br>
talk to German trade union and political leaders.<br>
"" I have nothing more to say on the Berlin position than what I<br>
said when I was there-that for the western powers to take any other<br>
stand was unthinkable.""<br>
GERMANY-BERLIN POSITION, AIR LIFT.<br>
On 2nd August, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Cabinet decided to-day to offer to the British Government the<br>
use of ten Douglas Dakota aircraft to assist in the air lift to Berlin, if<br>
required. If the offer is accepted, the ' planes will be flown by Royal Australian<br>
Air Force crews to Britain, where the uses to which the aircraft<br>
are put will be determined by the British authorities.""<br>
ITALY-TREATY, RATIFICATION.<br>
On 12th July, 1948, Dr. Evatt announced that the Australian instrunment<br>
of ratification of the peace treaty with Italy had been deposited<br>
on 9th July, 1948, and the state of war between Australia and Italy had<br>
ended as from that day. At Berlin. </p>
<p>ROUMANIA, BULGARIA, HUNGARY, FINLAND-TREATIES,<br>
RATIFICATION.<br>
On 13th July, 1948, Dr. Evatt said that the Australian instruments<br>
of ratification of the peace treaties with Roumania, Bulgaria, Hungary<br>
and Finland had been deposited on 10th July, 1948, and the state of war<br>
between Australia and those countries had ended as from that day.<br>
JAPAN-MINISTER'S STATEMENT, JULY, 1948.<br>
On 22nd July, 1948, Dr. Evatt said-<br>
It is becoming evident that peace and stability in the Pacific and<br>
in Asia will be attainable only so far as there is peace and stability in<br>
Europe. The problem is not regional, it is global. The situation in<br>
Berlin and Europe generally, where there is an acute dispute between<br>
Russia on the one hand and the western democracies on the other, must<br>
have a direct effect in delaying any peace settlement with Japan.<br>
Australia's concern in the European situation is direct and vital.<br>
Certainly no peace will endure unless it is based on justice and<br>
reached by free agreement in accordance with the principles of the<br>
United Nations Charter. The next meeting of the United Nations may<br>
well become a turning point in world history. I am hopeful that the<br>
Assembly will bring public opinion to bear on both political and<br>
economic aspects of international disputes and so contribute to the<br>
prevention of a third world war.""<br>
EXTERNAL TERRITORIES.<br>
PAPUA-NEW GUINEA-COPRA.<br>
On 7th July, 1948, the Minister for External Territories ( Mr.<br>
Ward) announced that the Australian New Guinea Production Control<br>
Board would relinquish control of marketing the Territory of Papua-<br>
New Guinea production of copra. The present rate of production of<br>
copra, over 40,000 tons a year, was about two-thirds of the potential<br>
output of the remaining coconut plantations and groves of the territory<br>
and negotiations were in course with traders in the territory to secure<br>
an orderly changeover of marketing activities under a system of export<br>
licences. The board, which was established during the war to secure<br>
from the territories the maximum possible produciton of copra and<br>
other tropical produce, would then wind up its affairs.<br>
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS.<br>
CO-OPERATION-PROPOSED SECRETARIAT.<br>
On 8th July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-<br>
"" Suggestions have been made for the establishment of a British<br>
Commonwealth of Nations Secretariat hut there is no evidence at present<br>
of anything of a concrete character.""<br>
( For earlier references, please see No. 98, page 46; No. 114, page 3.)<br>

PRIME MINISTER'S BROADCAST.<br>
On 12th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley broadcast over the British Broadcasting<br>
Corporation and Australian Broadcasting Commission networks.<br>
Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Good evening. I speak to-night to the people of Great Britain, to<br>
my own people in Australia and to listeners in the Pacific and North<br>
American areas.<br>
We live in difficult times, the world is suffering an uneasy peace.<br>
I have just returned from Berlin where I went so that I might get a<br>
first-hand picture of a very difficult position. Economic and political<br>
problems of a character never before encountered in our history have<br>
to be faced daily. There is little respite from them. But we are a<br>
sturdy race. Our Comnionwealth is composed of very determined<br>
people. If I needed any reminder of that fact, I have only to look at<br>
what the people of Britain have suffered and are suffering and what<br>
they are doing to lift themselves up towards a happier way of life.<br>
During the past week I have had the opportunity of talking with<br>
the British Prime Minister ( Mr. Attlee) and a number of his Ministers.<br>
It is natural that the British people are wondering what will be the<br>
outcome of the talks, while my own people at home will be interested to<br>
know what tasks lie ahead of them. My mission here at London,<br>
primarily, was economic. But I have also had more than one talk<br>
with the Foreign Minister ( Mr. Bevin) from whom I have obtained a<br>
very full picture of the world scene. I aim having talks with the<br>
Minister of Defence and with the Service Ministers.<br>
Perhaps I can best sum up my objective in coming to London<br>
in a sentence: I want to obtain, and to give, a clear understanding of<br>
the economic difficulties that confront the people of Britain and Au.-<br>
tralia. We want to determine, as well as circumstances will permit,<br>
our joint policies for the future.<br>
"" I say to my own people that the path is not easy, that the going<br>
is hard and will continue to be hard. Sir Stafford Cripps said last<br>
week that Britain was running into debt on her overseas trade to the<br>
tune of more than a million pounds for every working day. Australians<br>
know that our future is linked with Britain, not only hy ties of rnee<br>
and kinship, but because of hard, practical reasons.<br>
Tl'hre is a bond of gratitude between Britain and Australia<br>
because of the gallant part played by Britain in the war and in the<br>
post-war struggle to re-establish herself, and, at the same time, to assist<br>
others. The next three years may very well be the most crucial in the<br>
history of the British peoples. The key to the situation lies in production<br>
and I say to every Australian that hard work is not only a national<br>
duty but a stern responsibility if we are all to survive.<br>
"" I am not being alarmist. I have the advantage of knowing not<br>
some of the facts, but all the facts. I have talked with the best brains<br>
in Britain; men who devote day and night to the task.<br>
I </p>
<p>The Australian people have had imposed on them severe restrictions<br>
in order that the use of dollars should be reduced. The Australian<br>
Government realizes that, without substantial imports of capital<br>
equipment from America, the progress of the country's development<br>
will be seriously delayed. Nevertheless, the Australian Government<br>
is prepared to take appropriate action in the future; however strong<br>
it may be. I also add, in view of incorrect reports, that I did not<br>
coime to Britain to demand more dollars. My mission has been aimed<br>
at obtaining the fullest information so that economic policy, particularly<br>
as it affects dollars, can be laid down with reasonable certainty<br>
and that the efforts of the United Kingdom and Australia can be<br>
properly co-ordinated.<br>
To the British people, I say that I believe that much can be done<br>
in Australia to expand production of beef, dairy products and wheat.<br>
We lhav good seasonal prospects in Australia and it is hoped, for<br>
example, that lamb production this year will be 10,000,000 above an<br>
average year.<br>
"" I know that numbers of people in England, Scotland, Ireland<br>
: n d Wales are interested in going to Australia. The fullest understanding<br>
exists between the British and Australian Governments on<br>
this matter and to those who feel that delays are endless, I point out<br>
that, first, the ships have to be available, and, secondly, we have to<br>
pursue vigorously, which we are doing, a housing construction proegrnmin'<br>
Time is the arresting factor.<br>
It has been my privilege and pleasure auring my stay to meet Their<br>
Ma. jesties and the Princess Margaret and I have assured them, on<br>
behlilf of the people of Australia, of the warmest welcome when they<br>
visit us next year.<br>
Let : ijc. in saying good-night to you, tell you that the Australian<br>
people are constantly thinking of you. Our servicemen fought alongside<br>
you in two wars. We are standing by you now in fighting for<br>
economic stability. That may be, as I have said, a long fight, and<br>
each obstacle must be faced with the same courage that the people of<br>
Britain have shown in the last ten years. It will he our privilege, and,<br>
ind', d, oui' duty. to help in every way we can.""<br>
On 25th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley broadcast over some commercial<br>
stations-Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Good evening. As you know, I have just returned from a mission<br>
to London. My objective was primarily to discuss economic problems<br>
of mutual interest to the British and Australian Governments, but I<br>
also dealt with a number of other matters. All told, I attended two<br>
meetings of the British Cabinet and also talked with eleven members<br>
of the British Government-and with some of the Ministers I talked<br>
more than once.<br>
In addition, I visited Berlin, where I spent some hours with<br>
British, American, French and Australian authorities so that I might<br>
obtain first-hand information and be able to gauge the atmosphere<br>
4738.-3. </p>
<p>of the situation in the German capital. While there, I also talked<br>
with German trade union leaders and with members of the German<br>
civil administration in Berlin. Berlin presents a sad picture of the<br>
devastation of war. I have previously visited some of the worst war<br>
devastated cities, such as Hiroshima, Yokahama, Tokio, Manila and<br>
Rangoon. But, excepting Hiroshima, which was completely destroyed<br>
by the atomic bomb, I have not seen anything like the destruction in<br>
Berlin. Masses of bricks and rubble, gutted buildings, now mark this<br>
once beautiful city. It is a grim warning of the tragic consequences<br>
of war. On my way to London, and also on my way back, I talked with<br>
the British Commissioner-General at Malaya ( Mr. Malcoln<br>
Macdonald) and with the British Governor of Singapore ( Sir Franklin<br>
Gimson). I obtained from Mr. Macdonald a full background picture<br>
of the position in Singapore and Malaya.<br>
As the result of my talks at London, I can say that there is<br>
the fullest understanding between the British and .\ ustralian Governments<br>
on the economic matters that affect our common and national<br>
interests. Of course, we are in constant touch with each other by<br>
cable and often by radio-telephone. I told the British pcople, on<br>
your behalf and on behalf of all Australians, that it would be our<br>
privilege, indeed our duty, to help them in every way possible. I was<br>
glad to sec that, despite great economic difficulties, London and itpeople<br>
looked brighter than when I visited there in 1946. The gaping<br>
holes made by the doodle bugs"" and V2' s have been patched up.<br>
The people are better dressed. There are more things in the shop<br>
windows. British production is steadily increasing and their courage<br>
is an example to the world.<br>
While at London, I also said, and I give you a further reminder<br>
now, that the road ahead for the British peoples everywhere and,<br>
indeed, for nearly all the non-dollar countries, is going to be long<br>
and hard. I don't want anybody to think, because I have said that,<br>
that the British Commonwealth is not going to come tlrou: gh. It is<br>
going to be a tough fight, but I have not any doubts that we shall<br>
pull through. I feel confident that with the growing strength of the<br>
Dominions. the British Commonwealth can be made stronger than<br>
ever. One of the keys to the problem is increased production. The<br>
Macquarie electorate contains centres of both primary and secondary<br>
production. On the industrial side, there are places such as Lithgow,<br>
Portland and St. Mary's. Primary production of a varied nature is<br>
to be found in almost every part of Macquarie. Australia is pledged<br>
to assist Britain in every way possible and increased production is<br>
necessary to fulfil that pledge. In addition, our own welfare, the<br>
expansion and development of our country, are both wrapped up in<br>
our own capacity to do better. </p>
<p>"" Work-hard work-overtime, where necessary, must be undertaken<br>
as part of our national duty. We want to develop and build<br>
a greater Australia for our children. Further, our strategic position<br>
is not what it was. This is a shrinking world and Australia cannot<br>
feel immune just because, geographically, she is situated down under<br>
in the Southern Hemisphere. We have to build and maintain a strong<br>
Australia and, I repeat, hard work is the only way to achieve that.<br>
We owe that not only to our own people but to our Allies and, particularly,<br>
the United Kingdom. Let me illustrate to you how the<br>
world has shrunk. In fourteen and a half days, I covered just on<br>
28,000 miles by air. In other words, I travelled about 2,000 miles<br>
every day and did eight days work as well. I stopped at or passed<br>
over about a dozen different countries.<br>
"" There is no such thing to-day as the Far East. In fact, Asia<br>
and Europe have been brought almost as close to us as New Zealand.<br>
An island that is 450 miles away from Darwin and was just a spot<br>
on the map could very easily become of intense interest to Australia.<br>
I want Australians to realize that they must think and act as Australians.<br>
They must think and act in terms of the nation. Economic<br>
wevlfare, security and a contented future are all wrapped up in what<br>
we do as individuals and as a community.<br>
In your homes to-night, you are safe and secure. Your families<br>
rue around you. You are assured of full employment. You have<br>
boundless opportunities ahead of you. By contrast, I have seen places<br>
and talked with people in the grip of misery and hardship, indeed,<br>
with no future at all. Uneasy countries, worried peoples are to be<br>
found everywhere. The devastating hand of war has caused<br>
unbelievable material damage and worked shocking havoc in people's<br>
minds. The heritage that has come to us, the great chance for the<br>
future must not be frittered away. I ask the people of Macquarie, as<br>
I ask all Australians, to stand together for the national good and for<br>
their own good."" TARIFF.<br>
WESTERN CUSTOMS UNION.<br>
On 8th July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-<br>
The matter of the Western Customs Union would have to be a<br>
subject for discussion between Britain and the Dominions if it cut<br>
across Imperial preference in any way.<br>
Australia has assumed that no finality will be reached on the<br>
Western Customs Union without consultation with the Dominions.<br>
There has been no intimation yet by the British Government that it<br>
will be specially discussed with the Dominion Governments.""<br>

On Sth July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-<br>
have had discussions with the Minister for British Commonwealth<br>
Relations ( Mr. Noel-Baker) and further discussions will be<br>
held later. We have dealt with migration generally rather than any<br>
specific plans-matters such as ships and related problems. Many<br>
physical difficulties are in the way of mass migration and a lot of<br>
study and thought will be necessary and I do not think that mass<br>
migration is physically possible in the near future. I am satisfied<br>
that the British Government has been very co-operative in regard<br>
to shipping. There have been discussions regarding the transfer of some<br>
British industries to Australia but the tendency has been for British<br>
firms to establish branches in Australia or to expand existing branches-<br>
That has been going on fairly rapidly because of the sound Australian<br>
economy; the market in Australia; and the fact that Australia is a<br>
foctil point of development of eastern trade.""<br>

GOVERNMENT POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br>
On 1Sth July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said:-<br>
I had long discussions at London with the Minister for British<br>
Commonwealth Relations ( Mr. Noel-Baker) and the Minister for<br>
Transport ( Mr. Barnes). Despite the shipping shortage, I hope that<br>
the rate of migration will be stepped up very considerably for British<br>
migrants, displaced persons in Europe and Italians. At Berlin, I<br>
discussed with the United States authorities the possibility of securing<br>
additional displaced persons for Australia.""<br>
GOVERNMENT POLICY-MINERS.<br>
On 19th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said:-<br>
The British Government is endeavouring to use Polish niners.<br>
They are used in Wales. Difficulties are being encountered in<br>
Yorkshire. At the moment, trained Polish miners are not available<br>
for Australia but some Italian miners might be available. The matter<br>
would have to be discussed with the Australian Coal and Shale<br>
Employees Federation. One of the difficulties is knowledge of the<br>
English language and it would be necessary to teach them the rules<br>
and regulations of working."" At London. </p>

FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS, PRIME<br>
MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br>
On 8th July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-<br>
"" My mission to London is mainly on matters of economic interesis<br>
common to both British and Australian Governments. I hope that, as a<br>
result of the mission, the common bond between us will be strengthened<br>
in the best interests of . both Governments. Cables cannot fully cover<br>
the ground that can be covered by talks.<br>
Australia forms part of the dollar pool. It has been almost always<br>
a drawer on the dollar pool. We have been striving to cut d! own<br>
expenditure in many fields. The judgment as to what constitutes<br>
essentiality in dollar expenditure causes controversy but Australia feels<br>
that she must not draw any more dollars than are essential.<br>
"" In 1948-49, Australia anticipates making very substantiail ri. luetions<br>
in dollar expenditure and in the amount to be purchased from the<br>
British Treasury. The precise programme is difficult until revenue<br>
from Australian exports are knowin-an example being the revenue<br>
from Australian wool sold in the United States. Time often alters<br>
early figures. Further, rising prices often alter quantities.""<br>
On 18th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley -aid-<br>
I make it clear that I did not go to London to beg for dollars. The<br>
main objective of the visit was to find out how best we can co-ordinate<br>
the policies of the two governments having regard to the shortage of<br>
dollars; how Australia can share in the availability of goods from<br>
Britain, previously obtained from the United States and other hard<br>
currency areas; and to discuss a long-range policy regarding dollar..<br>
"" The European recovery programme provides only for Britain's<br>
dollar deficit and not for the Dominions' dollar deficits. It is doubtful<br>
if the European recovery programme makes full provision for the dollar<br>
deficits of Britain. One of Britain's problems is the increasing price<br>
of dollar imports. Although production is increasing-and increasing<br>
splendidly in some industries-some of the increased dollar earnings are<br>
offset by rising prices in America. As British leaders have said,<br>
increased production is one of the keys of the problem. It is also<br>
necessary in Australia if Australia's economic welfare is to assist in<br>
giving increased help to Britain-particularly in foodstuffs. I have<br>
not given thought to means of increasing production but the working<br>
of overtime is essential.<br>
"" It is no use disguising the fact that a long hard road is ahead<br>
because of the difficulty in getting dollar goods. It would be very foolish<br>
to think that either Britain or Australia can solve that as a . hortterm<br>
problem. At T. ondn. </p>
<p>The only solution to the present disequilibrium in dollars will<br>
be for the United States and other dollar countries to buy something<br>
equivalent in value to what they sell. That course seems unlikely so<br>
the sterling area countries must do the best they can with the dollars<br>
available. We have to face the inevitable by doing the best we can in<br>
the years ahead on the dollars available and in the meantime to<br>
produce our utmost.<br>
The Australian Government must be prepared to examine all<br>
avenues of trade to see how dollars can be saved. There is a complete<br>
understanding with the British Government as to the precise position<br>
and how best Australia can render assistance to Britain. The Australian<br>
Government has already planned reductions in dollar expeiditure.""<br>
On 19th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
"" The Australian Government is trying to divert imports into tho<br>
sterling area and the latest figures are-<br>
In May, 1947, 27 per cent. were from Britain, and in May, 1947, this had<br>
increased to 53 per cent. Imports from the total sterling area at the same<br>
dates were 44 per cent. and 66 per cent. respectively. Imports from the dollar<br>
area on the samine dates were 39 per cent. and 13 per cent. Total imports for<br>
the same dates were œ 23,000,000 ( Australian) and œ 31.000,000 ( Australian)<br>
respectively. "" It is hoped to get dollar imports down still lower but there i:<br>
always the problem of ever-rising prices in the United States.""<br>

On 19th August, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
"" I was aware that consideration was being given by the New<br>

had also been giving consideration to it. But I have no official<br>
intimation from the New Zealand Government of the contemplated<br>

Combined exports of dairy products ( butter, cheese and processed milk)<br>
were higher than pre-war. Other products which were exported in<br>
greater quantities were hares and rabbits, bacon and hams, preserved<br>
meat in tins, fruit in liquid, jams and jellies. Eggs and egg products,<br>
poultry, oats and barley were much higher than pre-war. Those in<br>
which there was a minor downward trend were sausage casings, citrus,<br>

CONFERENCE WITH STATES-DECISION.<br>
On 12th July, 1948, tie Minister for Commerce and Agriculture<br>
( Mr. Pollard) said that a conference that day with the State Ministers<br>
for Agriculture had resulted in the following decisions:-<br>
The Commonwealth Government shall guarantee a price of 6s. 3d. a hushel<br>
f. o. r. ports bulk basis for wheat grown and delivered by wheat-growers.<br>
The guaranteed price shall vary according to an index of production costs for<br>
each season starting with the 1948-49 crop.<br>
The guarantee shall apply to the wheat crop marketed through approved<br>
organizations for the period up to the end of the 1952-53 season.<br>
Approved organizations shall be the Australian Wheat Board and those<br>
organizations which are empowered by the State Parliaments with authority to<br>
receive wheat and to market it as the agents of the Australian Wheat Board.<br>
The Commonwealth shall ensure the guaranteed price in respect of the<br>
export from any one season's crop, provided that this guarantee shall not apply<br>
to the quantity of export in excess of 100,000,000 bushels.<br>
A stabilization fund shall be established by means of a tax on wheat<br>
exported to meet the guaranteed price above mentioned.<br>
The tax shall apply when the export price is higher than the guaranteed<br>
price, and shall be 50 per cent. of the difference between the two but shall not<br>
exceed 2s. 2d. a bushel.<br>
The tax slall apply to the 1947-48 and later wheat cropl.<br>
No refunds of tax from the fund shall he made ( except for the Il945-46<br>
and 1946-47, amounts already approved) except after consideration at sonim<br>
future date. The Commonwealth agrees that it will not hold an excessive<br>
amount in the fund, and it will consider a refund of tax to the oldest contributing<br>
pool whenever the financial prospects of the fund justify it.<br>
The State Ministers agree to recommend to their governments the pas; age iif<br>
legislation necessary to ensure-<br>
The home-consuinption price equal to the guaranteed price.<br>

reconstructed under the plans approved for the elimination of uneconomic<br>
wheat areas, and the establishment of a commiittee to advise<br>
in cases where action to regulate wheat-growing on marginal areas<br>
is necessary.<br>
The conference agrees, subject to acceptance by the respective State governments-<br>
That States, where they desire to do so, will constitute State whe. it<br>
boards composed of a majority of growers' rlpresentatives elected ly<br>

MALAYA-PRIME MINISTER'S STATMENT.<br>
On 18th July, 1043. the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
I cannot say I am very happy about the position in Singapore and<br>
Malaya. I had long discussions on my way to London and again on<br>
17th July, 1948, with the British Commissioner-General ( Mr.<br>
MoDonald). He is in the best position to judge and believes that the<br>
situation can be brought under control satisfactorily.""<br>
MALAYA-EXPORT OF ARMS.<br>
On 19th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The export of arms and war material from Australia to Malaya<br>
are matters that have not come before the Government for consideration.<br>
I do not recall any request by the late Sir Edward Gent. There is a<br>
long standing embargo on the sale of arms to anybody or any country.""<br>
On 21st July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The Customs Act provides for a prohibition on the export of arms,<br>
ammunition, explosives, military and naval stores. From the inauguration<br>
of the Commonwealth, there has been an export prohibition in<br>
one form or another on goods in this category. The existing prohibition,<br>
which came into operation in 1935, provides that none of these<br>
goods may be exported without the consent in writing of the Minister<br>
for Customs.<br>
"" Following the outbreak of disorder in Malaya recently, numbers<br>
of applications have been received by the Customs Department for permits<br>
to export automatic pistols and revolvers and ammunition therefor<br>
to individual persons and individual companies in Malaya for the selfprotection<br>
of themselves or of their employees. Applications have been<br>
made also for permits to export small bulk shipments through commercial<br>
houses. These applications have been granted subject to the following<br>
conditions:-<br>
That, from the perusal of the order and related documents, the Collector<br>
of Custonie at the port of export is satisfied as to the hona-fides of the case.<br>
That the goods are covered by an import licence issued by the police<br>
authorities in Malaya.<br>
That the goods are consigined to the Chief Police Officer in the district in<br>
which the consignee resides.<br>
No applications have been received for the exportation to Malaya<br>
of any machine, guns or sub-machine guns.<br>
As regards provisions of light machine guns or military equipment,<br>
no request has been made by the British Government for the supply of<br>
these weapons to Malaya. The Australian Army authorities already<br>
hold in custody 100 Sten guns which the British War Office has asked<br>
the Australian Government to dispose of as surplus equipment on its<br>
behalf. Should the British Government cancel this request and ask to<br>
have these guns delivered, they will be delivered as early as possible.<br>
If a request is received through the British Government for supply from<br>
Australian stores of similar equipment, to assist in the preservation of </p>
<p>17<br>
law and order in the area, the request will be referred to Cabinet at its<br>
meeting on 2nd August, in view of Cabinet's previous decision that no<br>
export of military equipment was to be permitted. Should Cabinet<br>
decide to vary this view and supply equipment, in response to such a<br>
request, this will also be delivered.""<br>
On 30th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The British Government, at the request of the Government of the<br>
Federation of Malaya, has asked for the early delivery of the 100 Sten<br>
guns belonging to them and held in Australia and has also asked<br>
whether the Australian Government would be ready to supply certain<br>
other automatic weapons, ammunition and equipment, which are required<br>
for the maintenance of law and order in Malaya, and which<br>
may be available here.<br>
In accordance with the statement I made on 21st July, 1948, the<br>
100 Sten guns, with ammunition, were despatched by air yesterday<br>
nnd should be delivered at Singapore later to-day for onward transit<br>
to the Malayan authorities, together with a few other items of equipment<br>
required for testing purposes.<br>
"" The question of the supply of weapons and equipment from Australian<br>
stocks will, in accordance with my statement of 21st July, 1948,<br>
bf, considered by Cabinet at its meeting on 2nd August, 1948. Meanwhile,<br>
the extent to which the item. required may be available here is<br>
being urgently examined.""<br>
On 2nd August, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Cabinet decided to-day that, where a request has been, or will be,<br>
made by the British Government for arms and equipment for use by<br>
the Government of the Malayan Union, these will be made available<br>
from Australian supplies within the reasonable limits of their<br>
a vailability."" INDUSTRIAL.<br>

PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED PERSONS.<br>
On 21st July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" To take full advantage of the knowledge and experience of<br>
existing staffs in extending the Government's plans for the rehabilitation<br>
of physically handicapped persons, it has been decided that the plan will,<br>
for the time being, be administered by the Department of Post-war<br>
Reconstruction. Legislation will be introduced to amend the Social Services Consolidation<br>
Act to vest the responsibility for the development of the<br>
scheme for rehabilitation of disabled members of the community in<br>
the Director-General of Social Services.<br>
The scheme will extend to invalid pensioners or claimants for thi<br>
invalid pension and those receiving or claiming unemployment or sickness<br>
benefits who would become unemployable unless rehabilitation<br>
assistance is provided.<br>
"" The Department of Social Services has already established a<br>
rehabilitation centre in each State except Tasmania, where facilities cf<br>
the Red Cross Society are u. ed.<br>
"" Staff employed by the Department of Social Services on this work<br>

responsible for the rehabilitation of many thousands of<br>
ex-servicemen, has a considerable number of permanent officers on it::<br>
. taff. These officers are still required for this work. It is recognized.<br>
however, that the work of post-war reconstruction will gradually declin..<br>
and that many of the permanent staff of that department trained in<br>
rehabilitation work might appropriately be transferred to the Department<br>
of Social Services. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction<br>

<p>COMMONWEALTH LOANS.<br>
FLOTATION COSTS.<br>
On 28th July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
During the war years and since, Commonwealth loan raisings have<br>
been conducted with remarkable economy and compare more than<br>
favorably with other countries. After provision is made for all charges<br>
-including advertising, brokerage, bank expenses and the Commonwealth<br>
Loani. Organization-the cost does not exceed 5s. per cent. This<br>
cost is less than one-third of the cost rate regarded as appropriate in<br>
some overseas countries.<br>
"" From the war-time peak of 360 in all States, the Commonwealth<br>
Loans Organization staff has been reduced to 130. The remaining staff<br>
is regarded as essential. It provides a nucleus of highly-trained persons<br>
whose services are fully employed on loan subscription, conversions and<br>
national savings campaigns.<br>
The Sixth Security Loan, opening on 8th September, 194S, is an<br>
iin'portant operation. Apart from œ 15,000,000 of new money, an appeal<br>
will be made to 300,000 holders of œ 85,000,000 of Commonwealth<br>
securities maturing in September-October, 194S, to convert into the<br>

AID ROADS AND WORKS ACT.<br>
PETROL TAX, GRANT FOR ROADS.<br>
On 6th August. 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" Representationis have been received from many sources that the<br>
whbole of the -proceeeds of taxation on petrol or a greater portion shiould<br>
be made available for roads purposes. </p>
<p>"" The petrol tax is not imposed solely for this purpose and although<br>
for many years substantial roads grants have been made to the States,<br>
the major portion of this tax has been required to meet the expenditure<br>
of the Commonwealth for general purposes and in particular, the heavy<br>
commitments for war and post-war purposes. The tax is primarily a<br>
revenue impost, in common with those imposed on many other item;,<br>
such as beer, tobacco and matches.<br>
"" About 90 per cent. of the petrol consumed in Australia for civil<br>
purposes is used for commercial and industrial purposes. To a great<br>
extent the cost is passed on to the general community in traisportatioa<br>
and delivery charges.<br>
Since the greater portion of the tax is not finally borne by the<br>
users of petrol but by the general community, it is inappropriate to<br>
contend that the whole of the proceeds should be usecd for roads<br>
purposes. Since the war the petrol tax has been reduced by Id. a gallon.<br>
As in the case of other forms of taxation, consideration is given to tile<br>
possibility of effecting reductions as the financial commitments of the<br>
Commonwealth permit.<br>
The whole question of Commonwealth assistance for roads received<br>
very full consideration when the Commonwealth Aid Roads and Works<br>
Act was ' passed in May, 1947. This legislation provides for the payment<br>
to State Governments over a period of three years of considerably<br>
increased amounts and one of its features is that it provides for ai<br>
special payment of œ 1,000,000 a year for the maintenance and construction<br>
of roads, other than main highways, through sparsely settled<br>
areas, timber country and rural areas. These payments are made in the<br>
first instance to State governments, since it is not the policy of the<br>
Commonwealth to give direct financial aid to local government bodies.<br>
Including the sum of œ 500,000 for expenditure by the Commonwealth<br>
on strategic roads and roads for access to Commonwealth properties,<br>
the amount so made available for roads purposes during 1947-48<br>
was œ 6,300,000, compared with œ 4,800,000 in 1946-47. The question<br>
of the adequacy of the present grant is being kept under notice by the<br>
Government. It was inevitable that the war-time diversion of practically Australia's<br>
total economic resources should result in some deterioration i,<br>
the condition of many roads. The question of restoration and improvc.-<br>
ment is not, however, solely one of finance. As a result of the suspension<br>
of many forms of ordinary economic activity during the war, resources<br>
of materials and man-power in Australia to-day are insufficient to me-t<br>
all requirements. If a greater sum were to be spent on roads, it is<br>
obvious that there would be a reduction in the allocation of labour and<br>
materials to other types of economic activity and apart from purely<br>
financial considerations, the expenditure of money on roads must be<br>
viewed in that light."" </p>

JUDGMENT, APPEAL.<br>
On 13th August, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
I have consulted all members of Cabinet on the High ( ou: l's<br>
judgment in the Banking case and a decision has been reached to seek<br>
an appeal to the Privy Council at the earliest possible date.<br>
direct attention to some aspects of the court's decision which it is<br>
desirable should be made clear to the public. A majority of the court<br>
has held that certain parts of the 1947 Act conflict with Section 92<br>
of the Constitution, which guarantees interstate free trade. That,<br>
however, is a matter on which there has been sharp division of opinion<br>
among the justices of the court, In the Chief Justice's opinion, the<br>
Act was fully within the principles relating to Section 92 established by<br>
the Privy Council.<br>
Apart from Section 92, the fundamental question is the scope of<br>
the National Parliament's power to make laws with respect to banking.<br>
On that point, a majority of the court substantially upheld the major<br>
contentions put forward for the Commonwealth by the Attorney-General<br>
( Dr. Evatt) and rejected the narrow. interpretation contended for by<br>
the private banks.<br>
The majority of the court also decisively rejected the special<br>
contentions put forward by the three plaintiff States.<br>
I am advised that the judgments of the Chief Justice and Mr.<br>
Justice McTiernan show that a few amendments in non-vital provisions<br>
would have enabled those justices to uphold the Act in all respects.<br>
Copies of the High Court judgments are being despatched to Dr.<br>
Evatt in London and will reach him early next week. I have arranged<br>
for the Solicitor-General ( Professor K. H. Bailey) to go to London<br>
as soon as possible for consultation with Dr. Evatt.'<br>

proposed that I address members of the Australian Coal and Shall<br>

NATIONAL DEBT.<br>
NATIONAL DEBT COMMISSION-ANNUAL MEETING.<br>
On 19th August, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said that<br>
the National Debt Commission had met that day when the annual report<br>
of transactions for the year ended 30th June, 1948, was presented, and<br>
consideration given to the application of sinking fund moneys accruing<br>
diiring 194S-49. </p>
<p>Receipts of the sinking fund for 1947-48 were œ 27,659,000. Receipts<br>
for 1948-49 were estimated at œ 28,785,000 being œ 18,592,000 on account<br>
of the Connuonwealth and œ 10,193,000 on account of the States. Of<br>
the latter amount, œ 1,851,000 would be provided from Commonwealth<br>
revenue. Total contributions estimated to be available for the redemption<br>
of the d,. bt of each State were-<br>
New South Wales, œ 4,000,000; Victoria, œ 2,034,000: Queensland, œ 1,475,000;<br>

The receipts totalling œ 28,785,000 were directed by the commission<br>
to be applied in the various markets in which Commonwealth and State<br>
securities were held-Australia, London and New York. The commission<br>
used its funds for the redemption of Commonwealth and State<br>
securities either by repurchase of securities on the market, or by redemption<br>
at maturity.<br>
The large sums applied in repurchases on Stock Exchanges ensured<br>
a regular market for security holders. When securities were acquired<br>
by the commission, either by repurchase or redemption, they were canrc'lled<br>
and the public debt reduced accordingly.<br>
Members of the commission were-<br>
The Couionwealth Trea-urer ( Mr. Chifey), chairman, the' Chief Justice<br>
( Sir Jolhn Lathami), the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank ( Mr. H. T.<br>
Armitagc), the acting-secretary of the Treasury ( Mr. G. P. N. Watt), the<br>
Solicitor-General ( Professnr K. H. Bailey) and Mr. A. T. Smithers, representati\<br>
ve . f tlwi States. GOLD MINING.<br>
ASSISTANCE.<br>
On 20th August, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The Commonwealth has agreed to provide a measure of assistance<br>
to three gold-mining companies in the Kalgoorlie area and to review<br>
the case of another Kalgoorlie mine when the financial results of its<br>
operations during 1948 are available. The request of a mine in the<br>
Cue district for assistance is still under consideration.<br>
The Commonwealth's agreement to provide this assistance, follows<br>
an application which was made by fifteen mines, through the Western<br>
Australia Chamber of Mines, to the Minister for the Interior ( Mr.<br>
Johnson). The Chamber claimed that a number of the mines would<br>
he forced to close as the present price of gold did not allow a sufficient<br>
margin to meet the rising costs. It was pointed out that the closing<br>
cf these mines would have a serious effect on the economy of Western<br>
Anctralia and might result in the abandonment of certain townships.<br>
Financial and technical investigations were made into the position<br>
of each mine. These investigations showed that a general form of<br>
assistance is not warranted. Many mines are still capable of paying<br>
good dividends even though rising costs are reducing the level of profits </p>
<p>to which the mines have been accustomed. A few of the mines included<br>
in the application are only salvage propositions, and Commonwealth<br>
assistance would not be justified under such circumstances.<br>
The mines wvhich it has been decided to aid during the current<br>
year have been informed of the termis of assistance, and the position of<br>
the indust ry in Western Australia will be reviewed early next year.<br>
Most mines are experiencing difficulty in maintaining production rate<br>
because of labour shortages.""<br>

PARLIAMENT.<br>
REPRESENTATION-AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY.<br>
On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The question of according representation in Parliament to residents<br>
of the Australian Capital Territory was considered by the Commonwealth<br>
Government in September, 1944, and the decision was<br>
deferred, the then Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) indicating that the<br>
matter would be approached again after the war and after the taking<br>
of the census. A deputation from the Citizens Rights League of<br>
Canberra has since waited on me and renewed the request that residents<br>
of the Australian Capital Territory be accorded representation in<br>
Parliament. 2565.-2 </p>
<p>Cabinet to-day decided to make a recommendation to the Federal<br>
Parliamentary Labour party that the Australian Capital Territory<br>
should be given representation in the House of Representatives on the<br>
same lines as is accorded to the Northern Territory.""<br>
REPRESENTATION-INCREASED MEMBERSHIP, BILL<br>
INTRODUCED:<br>
In Parliament.-On 16th April, 1943, the Attorney-General ( Dr.<br>
Evatt) introduced the Representation Bill. Dr. Evatt said-<br>
The purpose of this bill is to enlarge the Commonwealth Parliament.<br>
During the first ha] f century of Australia's history as a nation,<br>
its population has more than doubled. During these years there has<br>
been a great expansion, under the stimulus especially of t-wo world wars<br>
and a world depression, of the responsibilities borne by this Parliament.<br>
The purpose of the bill is to enlarge both Houses of the Parliament so<br>
that its numbers will be more in keeping with these fundamental<br>
iwtors in our political life.<br>
' 1To function efficiently, a democracy must devise a system of representaslon<br>
of the people in which the diverse views and interests of the<br>
community can find expression. This cannot be achieved if the number<br>
orepresentatives is too small. There is no automatic scale of numbers<br>
of areas for securing the best democratic results. Nevertheless, it is<br>
clear that Australia has altogether outgrown. the small Parliamentary<br>
bodies with which the federation was equipped in 1900. How small<br>
numerically is the Commonwealth Parliament, in comparison with some<br>
of the State legislatures, can be seen from the following figures:<br>
Legislative Legisative<br>
Cnujcl. Assemnbly.<br>
New South Wales 60<br>
Victoria 34<br>
Senate. Representatives.<br>
Commonwealth 36 74<br>
"" The Constitution empowers Parliament to increase the size of the<br>
Parliament if it thinks fit, but, : ys down certain conditions which must<br>
b'e observed. The most -important of these conditions is that the number<br>
of members of the House of Representatives must always -be as nearly<br>
as practicable twice the number of senators. If, therefore, the number<br>
of representatives is to be increased there must of necessity be a<br>
correlative increase in the number of senators. Accordingly, this bill<br>
effects an increase of the number of senators, with the appropriate<br>
correlative increase of the number of members of the House.<br>
The bill provides that there shall be ten senators for each State<br>
instead of six. Thus, the total number of senators will be increased<br>
from 36 to 60. Authority for the proposals contained in the ' bill is<br>
provided by the Constitution which sets out that the Parliament may<br>
make laws increasing or diminishing the number of senators for each<br>
State, but so that equal representation of the several original States </p>
<p>shall be maintained, and further, that whenever the number of -senators<br>
lb increased, the Parliament may make such provisions for the vacating<br>
of the places of senators as it deems necessary to maintain regularity<br>
in the rotation.<br>
The Constitution lays down that the number of members of the<br>
House of Representatives shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the<br>
number of senators. Therefore, if the number of senators is in-creased,<br>
as provided in the till now presented, the number of members of the<br>
House of Representatives must be correspondingly raised to a number,<br>
as nearly as practicable, twice the number of the senators. The actual<br>
number will probably be 121.<br>
Pursuant to the Constitution, and the Representation Act, the<br>
actual increase of the number of members of the House of Representatives<br>
which will follow the passing of this bill will be from 74 to 121.<br>
There will be no change in Tasmania, but in the other States the<br>
numbers will increase as follows-<br>
New South Wales-from 28 to 47.<br>
Victoria-from 20 to 33.<br>
Queensland-from 10 to 18.<br>
South Australia-from 6 to<br>
Western Australia-from 5 to 8.<br>
"" Since the establishment of the Commonwealth the population of<br>
Australia has more than doubled. It has increased from 3,765,339<br>
in 1900 to 7,580,820 in 1947. At the 1903 Senate elections 1,893,586<br>
electors were enrolled. To-day the number is 4,780,334, or more than<br>
two and a half times as many. In 1903, in the aggregate there was one<br>
senator for each 52,596 electors. To-day the ratio is one senator for each<br>
132,787 electors. If the number of senators is increased to 60, the<br>
ratio at the next elections will be one senator to each 83,000 electors<br>
approximately, which is less, proportionately, than in 1903.<br>
In 1903, each member of the House of Representatives represented,<br>
on an average, 25,247 electors. To-day, the average is 64,599, whilst<br>
if Tasmania is omitted, and allowance made for the expected rise in<br>
enrolment in the meantime, the average for the mainland divisions<br>
towards the end of this Parliament will be about 69,000 electors. However,<br>
if the number of members of the House of Representatives be<br>
increased. to 121, the average number of electors per member at the<br>
time of the next elections will be reduced to approximately 41,300, or,<br>
omitting Tasmania, 41,680.<br>
"" It is proposed to bring the Senate up to the full strength of<br>
senators as from the day of the first meeting of the Parliament after<br>
the next dissolution of the Rouse of Representatives. This will be<br>
necessary in order that membership of the Senate shall, from that date,<br>
be approximately half of that of the House of Representatives as is<br>
provided in the Constitution. Accordingly, the bill provides that apart<br>
from any long casual vacancies that may have to be filled, seven senators<br>
shall be chosen in each State at the next elections. </p>
<p>Four of the new senators elected in each State will take office<br>
as from the date of the first meeting of the Parliament after the<br>
elections, and, according to the order of their election, will continue<br>
in office until 30th June, 1956, or 30th June, 1953. The 4: 2 new<br>
senators, together with the eighteen who will not retire for a further<br>
three -years, will bring the Senate membership up to<br>
"" Under the present system, three senators will be elected for the<br>
ordinary six-year period of office which will commence as from 1st<br>
July following; that leaves four more to be elected. At each subsequent<br>
election of senators, five senators will normally be elected in each State,<br>
making 30 to -be elected at each periodical election."" [ The bill was passed.<br>
( Far earlier references, please see No. 134, page 28.)<br>
ELECTORAL ACT-PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION,<br>
SENATE, BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 16th April, 1948, Dr. Evatt introduced the<br>
Commonwealth Electoral Bill. Dr. Evatt said-<br>
The purpose of the bill1 is to make provision for the application<br>
of proportional representation to the election of senators. Before<br>
1918, senators were elected by what is termed the first past the post<br>
method. Each voter was required to place a cross in the square opposite<br>
the names of the candidates for whom he desired to vote, the number<br>
of crosses permitted being confined to the exact number of senators to<br>
be elected. Thus where three senators were required the three<br>
candidates with the greatest number of crosses were chosen, and as<br>
was usually the case the three elected were candidates of the same<br>
party. "" In 19418, the ' preferential block majority' system was introduced<br>
in respect of Senate elections. This system continued the principle<br>
of the old ' first past the post' system in that under it all seats in a<br>
State generally go to the party, or combination of parties, favoured<br>
at the time by a bare, or simple majority of the electors. It might<br>
he described as the all or none system, either all or none of a party's<br>
candidates being elected. The system used since 1918 may he considered<br>
an improvement on the old system only to the extent that it ensures<br>
majority representation as against possible minority representation.<br>
The great defect, from the representation aspect, of both the<br>
first past the post and the block majority'I system is that at an<br>
election, generally all seats in a State have been won by candidates<br>
of the one party, leaving a minority of between 40 to 50 per cent.<br>
of the electors without any representation at all in the Senate. For<br>
many years there has been a demand that the Parliament should<br>
provide a system of electing senators which would give more equitable<br>
results and enable the electorate to be more truly represented in the </p>

Senate. The Government has decided that, in relation to the election<br>
of senators, where each State votes as one electorate, the fairest system<br>
and the one most likely to enhance the status of the Senate is that of<br>
proportional representation.<br>
The bill sets out in detail the method of counting to be adopted<br>
in respect of future elections of senators. The method is generally in<br>
accord with the practice laid down by the Proportional Representation<br>
Society. All I need say about the principle is that the name of the<br>
system indicates the result intended to be achieved, that the electors<br>
will be represented, in the number . of those elected, approximately<br>
proportionately to their expression of opinion. For example, if five<br>
are to be elected and one party's candidates poll 55 per cent. of the<br>
total votes, the result would ' be that that party would have three<br>
candidates elected, and the remaining two elected, assuming that only<br>
two parties contested the poll, would be candidates of the opposing<br>
party and they would represent 40 per cent. of the electors. This<br>
system follows closely the provisions contained in the Proportional<br>
Representation Bill 1912 ( Great Britain) and the system employed in<br>
respect of municipal elections in Britain and South Africa. It is<br>
virtually identical with the method used in the election of the<br>
Parliament of Eire and is similar to the system employed in respect<br>
of parliamentary elections for the New South Wales Legislative<br>
Assembly from 1920 to 1925. In principle, the method proposed is<br>
the same as that used in Tasmania although for reasons of workability<br>
and simplicity it differs slightly in its practical application.<br>
It is not proposed to alter the existing style of Senate ballot-paper<br>
nor the provision that candidates may be grouped thereon with their<br>
names in such order within the group as they desire. Nor is it intended<br>
to vary the requirement that voters must indicate the order of their<br>
preference for all the candidates. Whilst this latter requirement might<br>
have the effect of continuing to produce a fairly high informal vote,<br>
it definitely precludes the possibly greater evil of exhausted votesthat<br>
is, votes which become exhausted in the process of transfer. If<br>
a voter were to indicate his preference for only three of, say, seven<br>
candidates, his vote would be effective up to the number of preferences<br>
shown on his ballot-paper and after that it would be effective nd longe'r.<br>
At that stage, the vote would be said to be exhausted. In Tasmaniaa,<br>
the elector need not vote for all candidates and therefore on occasions<br>
a fairly high percentage of votes becomes exhausted in the process of<br>
transferring the votes of a lower candidate or the surplus of a higher<br>
candidate to the next candidate in order of preference. One result of<br>
a system which does not require the electors to vote for all candidates<br>
whose names appear on the ballot-paper is that a candidate may be<br>
declared elected although the total number of votes credited to hifm<br>
falls, shot of the required quota. At the parliamentary elections in<br>
New South Wales in 1922 and 1925, the exhausted votes, which far<br>
outnumbered the informal votes, were the cause of much dissatisfaction<br>
and disputation.<br>
2565.-3 </p>
<p>"" The bill prescribes the manner in which the several vacancies<br>
shall be filled. As hitherto, the count will be carried out under the<br>
direction of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State concerned<br>
in thc offices of the respective Divisional Returning Officers. For<br>
instance, in New South Wales, where there are 47 divisions, there -will<br>
be 47 points at which the count will be carried out. This will ensure<br>
completion of count with the greatest safety, The maximum of speed<br>
and the minimum of cost. When the Commonwealth Electoral Officer<br>
has received the final results of the count of first preference votes from<br>
all returning officers and has totalled them, he will determine a quota<br>
by dividing the total number bf first preference votes by one more<br>
than the number of candidates required to be elected and by increasing<br>
the quotient so obtained by'one. That appears to be complicated, but<br>
if in New South Wales, for example, there were 1,600,00 valid votes<br>
and seven senators had to be elected, the total number would be divided,<br>
not by seven, but by eight, giving a quotient of 200,000. This would<br>
give a quota of 200,000 plus one.<br>
This formula for determining a quota, which, in effect, produces<br>
the lowest number which, when multiplied by the number of candidates<br>
to be elected, leaves a remainder of votes less than that lowest number,<br>
is the one recommended by the Proportional Representation Society<br>
and is used in Tasmania, in Fire, and generally in all places in British<br>
communities where proportional representation has been applied. Any<br>
candidate who, either on the count of the first preference votes or at any<br>
subsequent stage, obtains a number of votes equal to or greater than<br>
the quota shall be elected, and until all vacancies have been filled, the<br>
surplus votes-that is, any number in excess of the quota-of such<br>
elected candidate will be transferred in the manner set out in the bill<br>
to the continuing candidates in strict proportion to. the voters' next<br>
preferences. "" The method of disposing of an elected candidate's surplus votes<br>
prescribed in the bill is the one recommended by the Proportional<br>
Representation Society and is precisely the same as that used in Fire<br>
and in municipal'elections in Britain and South Africa, and it is similar<br>
to the method employed in oonnexlon with the parliamentary elections<br>
in New South Wales in the early nineteen-twenties. It differs from the<br>
Tasmanian practice in that whereas in Tasmania all the votes of the<br>
elected candidate are transferred at a fractional value so that every<br>
single paper is looked at under the proposed method only such number<br>
of votes as equals the surplus, taken in strict proportion to the preferences<br>
on the whole of the votes of the elected candidate, are transferred.<br>
No doubt that provision will require some consideration in<br>
committee. It is thought that the Tasmanian system, while suitable<br>
where the number of votes is comparatively small and all such votes<br>
are concentrated at one centre, is not readily capable of being efficiently<br>
worked by too remote a control. Consequently, to employ that system<br>
at a Senate election, it would first be necessary to assemble the whole of </p>
<p>the ballot-papers for the State at one centre. Not only would this delay<br>
completion, involve risks of loss in transit, and increase costs heavily,<br>
but also in the larger States the Commonwealth Electoral Officer would<br>
be faced with the almost insuperable task of securing for a period of<br>
several weeks the extensive accommodation, equipment and staff needed.<br>
"" While it might be claimed that the Tasmanian system is mathematically<br>
more exact, tests that have been made reveal that a similar<br>
result is obtained by the employment of the method proposed. As an<br>
illustration, I shall state a hypothetical case in New South Wales and<br>
for this purpose I shall assume for the moment that a Labour candidate<br>
has received 900,000 votes of the total number of 1,600,000. The quota<br>
being 200,000, he has a surplus of 700,000 votes for distribution. This<br>
would usually result in three full quotas being obtained for other candidates<br>
on the list. The proposal embodied in the bill is that the officers<br>
will not look at all of the votes. They will take the surplus available<br>
and will assume that the No. 2 vote, which would be the effective vote<br>
in the first instance, would reproduce a proportion in respect of the<br>
surplus of 700,000 that would be true of the total of 900,000. Tests<br>
have shown that the result would be the same as if all of the 900,000<br>
votes were scrutinized. Questioned as to the likelihood of difference,<br>
eminent mathematicians advised the Proportional Representation<br>
Society of England that-<br>
Whenever a considerable number of votes is in play the element of chance<br>
involved is so small as to be negligible.<br>
"" Dealing with the point in its comprehensive report on electoral<br>
systems, the British royal commission of 1908 said-<br>
The chance of the result being affected is too small to be seriously considered.<br>
We agree with the Proportional Representation Society that the additional<br>
labour involved ( in the Tasmanian system) is greater than it is worth.<br>
The bill further provides that if after the count of the first preference<br>
votes or after the transfer of the surplus votes of an elected<br>
candidate at any stage, no candidate or less than the number required<br>
to be elected has or have obtained the quota, then the candidate with<br>
the fewest votes shall be excluded and the whole of his ballot-papers<br>
transferred to the continuing candidates; and if thereupon no candidate<br>
has yet reached the quota, the process of excluding the candidate with<br>
the fewest votes and the transferring of his ballot-papers will continue<br>
until a continuing candidate has received a number of votes equal to<br>
the quota or in respect of the last vacancy a majority of the votes.<br>
Where candidates are elected at the same time, the order of their election<br>
shall be determined to the extent of their surplus votes. The candidate<br>
with the largest surplus shall be the first elected and so on. The same<br>
principle will apply in relation to the transfer of surplus votes. The<br>
largest surplus will be transferred first and so on. If on any count two<br>
or more candidates have an equal number of votes and one of them has<br>
to be excluded the Commonwealth Electoral Officer shall decide the<br>
candidate to be excluded, or if two or more candidates are elected with<br>
an equal number of votes the Commonwealth Electoral Officer will </p>
<p>decide the order of their election and the transfer of their votes, or if<br>
in the final count for the filling of the last vacancy two candidates have<br>
an equal number of votes, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer will<br>
decide which shall be elected but that except as so provided the Coinimonwealth<br>
Electoral Officer shall not vote at the election. That is<br>
really the last resort. The chances against its happening in a Senate<br>
election are enormous.<br>
The result of the system is clear. There will be two major groups<br>
of political parties, and seven senators will be elected, in the absence<br>
of any casual vacancies, in each State. The party which secures 53<br>
per cent. or .55 per cent. of the aggregate votes will, provided the party<br>
ticket is followed, have four of the seven candidates to be returned.<br>
The three remaining seats will be filled by the candidate from the other<br>
party which secured 47 per cent. of the votes. That is certain"".<br>

On 5th April, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
""' Cabinet to-day considered a report on the progress of the Australian<br>
antarctic expedition.<br>
"" Cabinet decided that the scientific and meteorological bases successfully<br>
established at Heard and Macquarie Islands in December,<br>
1947, and February, 1948, be maintained in accordance with original<br>
plans. The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) indicated that<br>
the development of a full programme ( including the establishment and<br>
maintenance of a permanent base on the A-ntarctic Continent itself)<br>
would involve the acquisition of a new ship in addition to the vessel<br>

WORLD ORGANIZATION-FREEDOM OF INFORMATION.<br>
On 18th April, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)<br>
said-The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information has<br>
reached important conclusions. It recommends to all countries positive<br>
measures to spread factual information on international affairs and<br>
it condemns all propaganda designed or likely to provoke or encourage<br>
any threat to the peace. Unanimity between the eastern and western<br>
nations of Europe was obtained and this is, in itself, one step forward<br>
in the positive effort to prevent World War III.<br>
The part played by Australia has been notable. Our delegation's<br>
imitiative has been widely and favorably commented on. Australia<br>
succeeded in securing the acceptance of one of the main resolutions.<br>
The chairman of the conference paid a special tribute to Auitralia,<br>
rebuffing the defeatist attitude of a tiny section of Australians who, in<br>
spite of the bitter lessons of the Pacific war, are opposed to the active<br>
participation of their country in international affairs.<br>
One of the greatest contributions to peace which can be made is<br>
to discourage propaganda and distorted reporting, which represents<br>
a real danger in times of international tension. The best way of<br>
preventing war-mongering propaganda is not any form of censorship,<br>
but fair and accurate reporting of the facts. The most effective way<br>
to handle war-mongers is not ' by suppression, but by free reporting.<br>
"" This Geneva success, following the General Assembly resolution,<br>
demonstrates that middle Powers like Australia can play a major<br>
role in composing differences between the great Powers, and in helping<br>
to ' prevent the world from crystallizing into rigid and opposing blocs. </p>
<p>14<br>
"" It is not enough to criticize war-mongering. Friendly relations<br>
between countries must be encouraged. Positive means of co-operation<br>
and assistance will soon arrest any ' drift towards war.""<br>

In Parliament.-On 7th April, 1948, the Leader of the Opposition<br>
( Mr. Menzies) moved the following motion:<br>
That in the opinion of this House<br>
Communist activities in Australia are subversive.<br>
( b Communists in Australia have fomented widespread stoppages of<br>
employment, sought to weaken the authority of the industrial law,<br>
and inflicted misery and loss upon thousands of citizens.<br>
There is good reason to believe that Australian Communists act in<br>
the interests of a foreign power.<br>
Recent events in Europe have p roved that Conmmunist minorities in<br>
counitries outside the Soviet Union are organized so as to overthrow<br>
hy force majority rule in those countries.<br>
The Governnient has failed to take any adequate steps to attack<br>
Communist activities in Australia, or to prevent the employment<br>
of Communists by the Commonwealth.<br>
And that by reason of the above the Government deserves the censure of this<br>
House. Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Mr. Menzies has made what purports to be a denunciation of a<br>
great social evil in this community, but, in a speech of more than<br>
minutes' duration, he did not make one suggestion as to how that evil<br>
should be cured. The press has done him a grave injustice. The press,<br>
for some weeks now, has carried announcements that at last he has </p>
<p>been weaned or forced--I presume forced-from his previous views<br>
in regard to communism. One would, accordingly, have expected him<br>
to-day to have taken the high jump at the suggestion of the Australian<br>
Country party, and plump for the banning of the Communist party;<br>
but he did not do so. In a speech lasting for more than 40 minutes<br>
he did not say one word about banning communism, nor did he make<br>
one single suggestion as to how Communists should be dealt with.<br>
"" Unfortunately, a flood of communism has swept Europe. Communism<br>
is rife not only in countries that are under Communist domination<br>
but also in the countries that are still democratic. That is the fruit of<br>
hundreds and hundreds of years in which 80 per cent. of the people<br>
lived in the direst poverty. That is why the world has to suffer<br>
communism to-day. The soil in which communism has flourished was<br>
fertilized by people without any idea of democracy. From one extreme<br>
the people have swung to the other. In most countries there are<br>
Communist elements. Twenty-five years ago the Communists were<br>
supposed to be confined to common people, manual labourers and people<br>
of that character, but to-day communism has become something in the<br>
nature of a religion and has drawn into its ranks many intellectuals.<br>
They are classed as Communists, fellow travellers, and crypto-<br>
Communists by those who see in the movement, as I do, the grave<br>
menace to democracy that communism presents. But the evil will not<br>
be cured or the blight on the world removed by the sort of loose talk<br>
that goes on in Australia and other countries. I cast my mind back<br>
to five years ago, when, as Treasurer, I said to the then Prime Minister,<br>
the late Mr. John Curtin-<br>
War or no war, I believe that every government has to stand up to the task<br>
of ensuring social security to the people, because, if it does not, I fear that,<br>
with the end of the war, the great mass of the people will be gravely dissatisfied<br>
and wonder what the war was fought for if they are left with only poverty and<br>
misery and no security.<br>
"" With the help and advice of my colleagues in the Australian<br>
Labour movement, I launched the system of social security that we<br>
enjoy to-day. In the previous 40 years, when for most of the time,<br>
the anti-Labour parties were in power-the Labour party had few<br>
years in office-not one piece of social legislation was passed by the<br>
Australian Parliament. I mention that because the only way in which<br>
to defeat communism is for the democracies of the world to be readily<br>
democratic. "" Much has been said about the suppression of minorities. According<br>
to press reports, Mr. Menzies made some rather scathing comments<br>
about my statement that the Australian Labour party would not lend<br>
itself to the banning of a political party, because it held a certain<br>
political philosophy. The Australian Labour party is entirely opposed<br>
to the principles of communism, including its economic theories for<br>
the management of a country, and its attitude towards religion. I<br>
speak for the Government as well as for myself when I say that we<br>
completely abhor the principles of communism for the attainment<br>
of the party's objectives. However, I shall never support any policy </p>
<p>I; 16<br>
which is designed to deprive minorities of the right of expression<br>
unless-I qualify that statement-those expressions are subversive,<br>
seditious or in some way detrimental to the safety of the country.<br>
"" I remind opposition members that not one English-speaking<br>
country, with the exception of Canada and Australia in war-time,<br>
has placed a ban on the activities, political or otherwise, of the<br>
Communists.<br>
J "" I propose to place on record the statement of the Prime Minister<br>
of Britain ( Mr. Attlee) from the Hansard report of the House of<br>
Commons, dated 15th March, 1948-<br>
1 desire to mnake a statement in regard to certain matters of employment in<br>
the Civil Service.<br>
In answers to questions on the subject of the transfer or dismissal of certain<br>
Government servants, I have said that there are 4certain duties of such secrecy<br>
that the State is not justified in employing in connexion with them any one<br>
whose reliability is in doubt.<br>
Experience, both in this country and elsewhere, has shown that membership<br>
of, and other forms of continuing association with, the Communist party nmkay<br>
involve the acceptance of the individual of a loyalty, which in certain circumstances<br>
can he inimical to the State.<br>
It is not suggested that in matters affecting the security of the State, all<br>
those who adhiere to the Communist party would oallow themselves thus to forget<br>
their primary loyalty to the State. But there is no way of distinguishing such<br>
people from those wvho, if opportunity offered, would he prepared to endanger<br>
the security of the State in the interests of another Power. The Government<br>
has, therefore, reached the conclusion that the only prudent course to adopt is<br>
to ensure that no one who is known to be a member of the Communist party, Or<br>
to be associated with it in such a way as to raise legitimate doubts about his or<br>
her reliability, is employed in connexion with work, the natuie of which is vital<br>
to the security of the State.<br>
Thie same rutle will govern the einploynient of those who are known to be<br>
actively associated with fascist organizations.<br>
I should emphasize that this actioii is being takeii solely on security grounds.<br>
The State is not concerned with the political views, as such, of its servants,<br>
and as far as possible alternative employment on the wide range of non-secret<br>
government work will be found for those who are deemed for the reason indicated<br>
to he unsuitable for secret work. It may, however, happen that it is impossible<br>
to find suitable employment elsewhere in the Civil Service for individuals with<br>
specialist qualifications.<br>
And in such cases there may he no0 alternative to refusal of employment or<br>
dismissal. I do not propose to read all the questions which members of the<br>
House of Commons directed to the Prime Minister in the course of this<br>
statement, but I do desire to read a question by Sir Ian Fraser, whose<br>
loyalty nobody doubts. Sir Ian asked-<br>
In applying the restriction in the Government service, and as far as it affects<br>
the British Broadcasting Corporation and the country generally, will the right<br>
honorable gentlem~ an advise that it shall he kept within the very narrow limits<br>
related strictly to security. Otherwise, does he not think that it is an unaccusturned<br>
and difficult course on which lie may he embarking?<br>
I invite Opposition members to listen carefully to Mr. Attlee's<br>
reply-I think I made it abundantly clear in my statememit that this wvas restricted<br>
to very narrow limits where security matters were of importance.<br>
I have been asked to explain what action the Government is taking<br>
against the Communists. The Government has not waited for this<br>
clamour and for what I may describe as this wave of hysteria which is </p>
<p>17<br>
sweeping through the world and which could lead to the grave consequences<br>
of war, when a little cool-headedness may avoid it. The Government<br>
has always considered that, in mat ' ters involving security, all<br>
persons entering the Public Service should he checked; and all members<br>
of the Public Service, even though they may not have been engaged in<br>
security work, have been subject to close scrutiny. I give to the country<br>
a complete assurance that so far as the Commonwealth Investigation<br>
Service and the State police forces can detect, no person whom Mr.<br>
Attlee's description fits, is engaged in vital security work. The Government<br>
did not wait for the present clamour, which has been raised in<br>
the press, or any other agitation before taking steps to safeguard the<br>
country. "" The Australian Labour party is completely opposed to the principles<br>
of communism. Let us he quite honest about this matter and<br>
admit that within the ranks of every political party there are people<br>
out on the wings who are extremely radical in their views. That,<br>
incidentally, is the only reason why there is a Labour party to-day.<br>
There would never have been a Labour party if there had not been in<br>
the community radicals-democratic radicals-who loved their country<br>
and fought for what they believed to be in the interests of the majority<br>
of the people. The men who formed the Australian Labour party had<br>
to contend with the bitterest opposition, with talk of socialism and<br>
the red tiger' 1, and it was even alleged by their opponents that they<br>
advocated the breaking of the marriage tie. However, in the face of<br>
all that opposition they triumphed, and the history of the Parliament,<br>
and particularly that of the last six years, proves that. When this<br>
country was confronted by the gravest peril in its history-and I ask<br>
members of the Opposition to turn this one over in their minds-the<br>
people of Australia entrusted the administration of the country's<br>
affairs, not to a conservative party, but to the Australian Labour party,<br>
which represented the people. If any political party was ever condemned<br>
at the throne of judgment in its country's hour of trial it was<br>
the conservative parties opposite. Tens of thousands of people who had<br>
never voted for a Labour candidate in their lives voted Labour. They<br>
said, in effect, ' In a great crisis these are the only people who can do the<br>
job effectively ', and the people of Australia virtually expressed the<br>
same opinion when they voted at the last general elections.<br>
Members of the political party to which I belong have as much<br>
love for this country and the safety of its people as the members of<br>
any other political party. Opposition members should not think that<br>
they possess a monopoly of love of country. Members, of the Australian<br>
Labour party have always been independent in their regard for the<br>
welfare of the people. We have consistently advocated changes designed<br>
to improve the lot of the mass of the people of this country, and I think<br>
that that is proved by our political record.<br>
"" I do not intend to weary the House by reading the text of resolutions<br>
adopted by the federal executive of the Australian Labour party,<br>
but year after year that body has expressed, on behalf of the Labour </p>
<p>18<br>
movement in Australia, its strongest opposition to the Communist<br>
party. As I said previously, it is true that in every political party,<br>
including the Australian Labour party, there are radicals and militants.<br>
However, many of those people are perfectly honest and quite sincere<br>
and have no association with Communists. Opposition members cannot<br>
blame the Australian Labour party for tbat. Behind the Opposition<br>
political parties are objectionable people, people whom Opposition<br>
mlembers would disown and whomn Mr. Menzies would disown. In the<br>
same way there are on the edge of the Australian Labour party men<br>
wvho are quite sincere, but quite radical and militant, and the views<br>
which they express can easily be misinterpreted as expressions of<br>
disloyalty. I have seen a great deal inside the industrial and political Labour<br>
movement, and I have read some history. I have never known of any<br>
minority movement in history that has not grown stronger by repressive<br>
aFction. Let me emphasize this never is liberty more easily lost than<br>
when we think we are defending it. My recollection embraces the<br>
history of quite a few minority movements. Some were religious, some<br>
were political and others were national in aim. Strenuous efforts were<br>
mnade to repress many of then], but in almost every case they grew<br>
stronger by repression. I have said in this House before that the people<br>
wvill not finially accept brutal, repressive action. We can only overcome<br>
communism in one way. Comm unism. can only be beaten by improving<br>
the conditions of the people bad conditions are the soil in which it<br>
thrives. There is talk of gaining political advantage or positions in<br>
Parliament, but to me liberty is far more important than that. I<br>
should not be a member of this Parliament if some tolerance had been<br>
extended to the men who took part in the strike of 1917. All that<br>
harsh oppressive treatment did, as far as I was concerned, was to transform<br>
me, with the assistance of my colleagues, from an ordinary<br>
common engine-driver to the Prime Minister of this country. If an<br>
example of what harshness can do is required, my presence in this<br>
Parliament should be sufficient.<br>
This Government will leave no stone unturned in its efforts to<br>
encourage the trade unions to prevent their control by Communists.<br>
The unions have got to do that themselves it is their task. From the<br>
political and defence point of view, the Government will do everything<br>
possible to provide that neither Communists nor fascists are associated<br>
with the work of ensuring the security of Australia. We shall not<br>
begin to chase shadows. If a ban is imposed on the Communist party,<br>
it will merely change its name, as it did in Canada, and go on in<br>
exactly the same way. We are going to fight Communism in the open.<br>
If there are persons in this country who are seditious, treasonable or<br>
subversive, there are laws by whichi they canl be dealt with, and this<br>
Government wil] deal with them [ T'he motion was defeated. </p>

UNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.<br>
On 7th April, 1948, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway) said<br>
that the demand for labour in Australia reached a new record high<br>
level in February, 1948. Unfilled vacancies held by the Commonwealth<br>
Employment Service numbered 58,300 for males and 36,800 for females,<br>
the. total of 95,100 being nearly 3,000 greater than the previous record<br>
high level. Unemployment, although practically negligible for months<br>
in. all States, except Queensland, had fallen even further. Recipients. of<br>
unemployment benefit ( including re-employment allowance) numbered<br>
6,410 males and 209 females. During February, 1948, the Commonwealth<br>
Employment Service had referred 27,200 males and, 8,100,<br>
females to employers, and had given advice and information on. various<br>
matters to 28,500 males and 6,400 females.<br>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT.<br>
REOONSTITUTION BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 14th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br>
Chifley) introduced the Supply and Development Bill. Mr. Chifley<br>
said-In Britain, the services essential to the armed forces are provided<br>
by the Ministry of . Supply, and in the ' United ' States by the Munitions<br>
Board. The Australian Government has decided that there must be<br>
a complementary body in the Commonwealth and has re-instituted the<br>
Department of Supply and Development. Under an act of 1939, a<br>
Department of Supply and Development was set up to be concerned with<br>
the procurement and manufacture of supplies and munitions for the<br>
armed services and to develop the resources of the Commonwealth so<br>
that we might be prepared in the event of war. On the outbreak of war<br>
the department was concerned with the procurement of war supplies and<br>
with the production of munitions and aircraft, but a separate Ministry<br>
of Munitions was set up in 1940, and, in 1941, a further Ministry of<br>
Aircraft Production was established. Meanwhile the Department of<br>
Supply was merged in a Department of Supply and Shipping.<br>
With the end of the war, the departments took up an active policy<br>
of reconversion to peace-time conditions in industry and a stage has<br>
now been reached at which they can merge again in a combined Department<br>
of , Supply and Development with functions similar to those which<br>
obtained before the war. The principal change to be made in the act<br>
is the substitution of the expression war materiel for munitions'<br>
wherever the latter occurs. The expression has a much wider meaning<br>
than munitions and is so used in the British and United States<br>
forces. It may be defined as including everything used in war except<br>
the personnel. The intention of the amendment is that the responsibility<br>
for provision of the needs of warfare, except man-power, shall be<br>
placed upon the new department.<br>
The general organization of the department contemplates that<br>
there shall be boards responsible for the management and administration<br>
of the following four main groups of undertakings:-<br>
Munitions production, including arms and ammunition factories; aircraft<br>
production factories; long-range weapons research and experimental establishment;<br>
ship construction and repairs.<br>
There will be branches concerned with procurement of supplies<br>
from industry for the services, including a Contract Board, mineral<br>
resources development, including geophysical and geological surveys,<br>
stores and transport services for the Commonwealth departments, and<br>
scientific research and technical advice for defence purposes and for<br>
assistance to industry generally.<br>
Provision is made in the act to ensure the safety of the public in<br>
connexion with the operations of the long-range weapons range and to<br>
acknowledge the possibility of compensation should accidents unfortunately<br>
happen. Provision is made for secrecy on the part of persons </p>
<p>employed on the operations, and for the steps neccessary to prevent<br>
enitry of unauthorized persons on secret defence undertakings and for<br>
search of suspected persons in such areas, particularly in respect of<br>
dangerous inflammable materials or explosive substances.<br>
"" The bill provides for continuity of service in regard to the technical<br>
staff and employees transferred from other departments during<br>
the war or engaged specially under regulations of the National Security<br>
Act, so that such rights and privileges as they may have acquired as<br>
a result of their service under the ! Commonwealth may be continued.<br>
Opportunity is being taken to amend the act so that those salaried<br>
employees formerly exempt from the operation of the Public Service<br>
Act will be transferred to the Commonwealth Public Service and be<br>
governed by the Public Service Act."" [ The bill was passed.<br>

On 16th April, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)<br>
announced that lamb would be removed from price control from 19th<br>
April, 1948. The good season with the prospect of another wool clip<br>
at a high price had encouraged graziers to hold stock, with the result<br>
that a shortage of lamb could be expected during the coming winter.<br>
Although there would be no general shortage of meat the shortage of<br>
lamb created conditions favorable to the blackmarketer against<br>
whose competition reputable traders could not carry on except at a<br>
heavy loss. NEW ZEALAND.<br>

Consideration was given to matters relating to the scientific<br>
aspect of defence policy arising from the conclusions and recommendations<br>
of the 1947 meeting at London of the British Commonwealth<br>
Advisory Committee on Defence Science and from the first<br>
report of the Defence Scientific Advisory Committee.<br>
The progress of the joint United Kingdom-Australian long range<br>
weapons project was considered.<br>
Decisions were taken on the organization for the executive of<br>
defence research and development.<br>
"" Another meeting of the council will be held next week at which<br>
the progress of the defence programme will be reviewed, following<br>
which a statement will be made by the Minister for Defence ( Mr.<br>
Dedman) in Parliament."" TRADE MARKS.<br>
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.<br>
On 20th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) reported to Cabinet to-day<br>
that a licence by a proprietor of a trade mark to another to use the<br>
trade mark on goods other than those of the proprietor of the trade<br>
mark is a form of deception which invalidates the registration of the<br>
mark. This rule applies when the proprietor of a mark owns and<br>
controls the other party to whom the licence is given. Consequently,<br>
a parent company cannot license a subsidiary company. In Britain,<br>
legislation has been passed whereby a person, other than a proprietor<br>
of a trade mark may be registered as a registered user of the mark.<br>
Conditions of registration are laid down and provision is made against<br>
I trafficking."" Cabinet decided to-day that the Trade Marks Act should be amended<br>
along the lines of the British Act to provide for permitted users of<br>
trade marks and assignment of trade marks without assignment of<br>
goodwill. It has been pointed out that many Australian companies<br>
have subsidiary companies operating in different States, and if any of<br>
these separate legal entities uses the registered trade mark of the<br>
parent company the registration of the mark is invalidated. Further,<br>
many overseas manufacturers desire to make arrangements with Australian<br>
companies for the local manufacture of goods formierly manufactured<br>
overseas and sold under well-known trade marks. The<br>
proposed amendment of the act will help in the industrial development<br>
of Australia and the establishment of new industries."" </p>

INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT.<br>
BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament On 22nd April, 1948, the Minister for Agriculture<br>
( Mr. Pollard) introduced the International Wheat Agreement Bill.<br>
Mr. Pollard said-<br>
The object of this bill is to ratify the international wheat agreement<br>
drawn up in Washington in March, 1948, by the representatives<br>
of the governments of 36 countries. The agreement is subject to<br>
ratification, or formal acceptance, by the governments concerned by<br>
1st July, 1948.<br>
"" At the outbreak of war in September, 1939, the f. o. b. Australian<br>
export price of wheat was around 2s. Australian currency a bushel.<br>
Some transactions took place at about is. 10d. a bushel at this time.<br>
Two years previously the average f. o. b. price was around 5s., Australian<br>
currency. For some years into the war, accumulated supplies and<br>
harvests were such that prices rose very slowly. At the end of 1943<br>
the Australian Wheat Board's export price was 4s. lid. bulk,<br>
for sales west of Suez and 4s. 7td. for sales east of Suez. At the close<br>
of the recent war there was a world-wide food shortage. There was<br>
a delay in getting European wheat countries back into production.<br>
Prices obtainable by exporters rose to record heights until in November,<br>
1947, the price on the Chicago market for the shortest term futures<br>
rose to 3 dollars 20 cents, the export equivalent for shipments from<br>
Gulf of Mexico ports being 3 dollars 30 cents, or 20s. 9d. Australian.<br>
At this time and for some weeks afterwards Australia was obtaining<br>
19s. 6d. a bushel for its wheat. Later, the Australian Wheat Board<br>
increased its price to 20s. 6d. a bushel.<br>
It is difficult to say precisely what world prices are, and it is clear<br>
that there is no world price in the pre-war sense. In normal times,<br>
wheat was traded freely at exchanges in Winnipeg, Liverpool, the<br>
Baltic, in London, and at Chicago and Minneapolis. Now Liverpool<br>
and Winnipeg are closed, and Chicago and Minneapolis deal largely<br>
with the huge American domestic consumption-a figure exceeding the<br>
Canadian and Australian production put together. At the end of<br>
January, 1948, when negotiations for the agreement opened, Canada<br>
had a contract, entered into in 1946, to sell a substantial proportion of<br>
its exportable surplus to Britain up to the end of July, 1950. The<br>
price for deliveries during the year, 1st August, 19-17, to 31st July,<br>
1948, was fixed at 1.55 dollars or 9s. 8d. Australian a bushel in store<br>
Fort William/ Port Arthur. For deliveries during 1948-49, the price<br>
is to be 2 dollars or 12s. 5d. Australian a bushel. In January, Canada<br>
was selling to other countries at prices around 3.25 dollars-about<br>
œ 1 Australian-a bushel, which were comparable with the United States<br>
export price. Australia had negotiated contracts with Britain and<br>
India for the sale of 105,000,000 bushels, at prices of 17s., equivalent<br>
to about 2.7 dollars a bushel, in the case of Britain and of 18s. 6d.,<br>
equivalent to about 3 dollars a bushel, in the case of India. The </p>
<p>' Wheat Board's export price at the end of January was 20s. 6d. a bushel.<br>
The Argentine was selling at about 5 dollars or over 30s. a bushel.<br>
With all these varying prices, and with so little wheat being sold<br>
on a freemarket, it is clearly unsound to refer to a ' world price<br>
"" A world price of course means competition between suppliers.<br>
Now no competition exists. Where there is competition it must be<br>
expressed in comparable * prices in the buying markets, whether these<br>
prices are brought back to f. o. b. for quotation or left c. i. f. Where a<br>
supplying country, Australia is an example, has one f. o. b. quote for all<br>
countries it is evident that there is no world price, since it means that<br>
each country is paying a different landed price for Australian wheat<br>
because of the difference in cost of freight. The Chicago market has<br>
been assumed by some to give world prices, but it is clear that this is<br>
not so when Argentina can obtain prices much higher than the export<br>
equivalent of the Chicago price. However, it can be said on the following<br>
reasoning that Chicago prices give a good indication of the trend of<br>
the market. Chicago prices, in the mnain, over a period are influenced<br>
by the quantity of wheat the United States Government takes off the<br>
domestic market. If a slackening in demand on American export wheat<br>
reduces pressure on Chicago, prices fall there and American wheat for<br>
export falls correspondingly. As soon as there is sufficient whea~ t<br>
coming from other countries to cause an exporter to offer wheat in the<br>
same market as America, competition will arise. A world price will<br>
then he quotable, and in the different supplying countries quotes will<br>
be based on competitive landed prices in importing countries.<br>
"" Following an exchange of views between their govern-ments,<br>
officials of Argentina, Australia, Canada, the United States and<br>
Britain met in Washington in July, 1941. A preliminary report was<br>
submitted in August, 1941, in which the principles of acreage control,<br>
price ranges and export quotas were again put forward. The Governmnents<br>
agreed that their representatives should meet again to work over<br>
the details of the proposed agreement. The conference was resumed in<br>
October, 1941, and met at various dates up to April, 1942, when a<br>
memorandum of agreement, to which was attached a draft convention,<br>
was drawn up and accepted by the Governments of Australia, Argentina,<br>
Canada, the United States and Britain. This memorandum indicated<br>
agreement among the four principal exporters on quotas. On the basis<br>
ef aggregate exports of 500,000,000 bushels, the percentages were,<br>
Canada 40 px_ nt., Argentina 25 per cent., Australia 19 per cent.,<br>
and United States 16 per cent.<br>
From 1943 to 1946, frequent attempts were made to reach an<br>
agreemient on price ranges for incorporation in an agreement for the<br>
stabilization of trade during the war and early post-war years. The<br>
stumbling block was a'lways the price ranges, Britain being unable to<br>
mneet the views of the exporters. By 1943, the Australian Wheat Board<br>
was in existence. It was constantly consulted by the department on<br>
details. </p>
<p>' I 26<br>
"" At the conference in London in March, 1947, it was made clear<br>
that Argentina would not be a participant, and a new approach was<br>
attempted, the new feature introduced -being guarantees by individual<br>
importers to take specified-quantities. Though agreement was not<br>
reacahed on all details, the principles stated in 1947 were used as the<br>
basis of negotiations at the recent conference in Washington at which<br>
full agreement was reached.<br>
"" The quantity of wheat covered by the agreement is 500,000,000<br>
bushels, of which. Australia's share is 85,000,000. Australia is bound to<br>
supply this quantity if it possibly can. If it cannot provide 85,000,0%,<br>
bushels, the United States anid Canada wvill be first asked to make up the<br>
discrepancy. If they cannot do so, then Australia is released from: its<br>
obligations, provided that its failure is due to crop losses and is not due,<br>
for example, to having made large sales outside the agreement. If<br>
Australia has more than 85,000,000 bushels to sell, it may sell-additional<br>
wheat outside the agreement, either to countries not in the agreement,<br>
or by making increased sales to countries within the agreement. From<br>
conversations not yet on a formal -basis, it is apparent that Britain<br>
together with the colonies for which Britain has assumed responsibility<br>
in thc agreement, will require more than the quantity provided for it in<br>
the agreement-180,000,000 bushels. Some of this extra quantity will<br>
certainly be drawn from Australia outside the agreement.<br>
The 85,000,000 bushels is considered to be adequate. In fact, it<br>
was not considered that Australia would be justified, under the terms: of<br>
the agreement, in seeking a higher -figure. It is estimated that. this will<br>
require an average harvest over the five years of about 170,000,000<br>
bushels, and that an average of .180,000,000 bushels would not be an<br>
embarrassment. In the first year of the agreement it is certain that<br>
we will be able to sell all our excess over the 85,000,000, and it is<br>
almost certain that we shall do so in the second year-August, 1949, to<br>
July, 1950-and that we shall enter into the third year of the agreement<br>
with a low carry-over. Even with heavy harvests, therefore, some<br>
increase of carry-over in the later years of the agreement could be<br>
accepted without difficulty.<br>
"" No provision is made in the agreement for restriction of production,<br>
but if supplying countries produced more than their quota, and<br>
other quantities they could sell outside the agreement, they might be<br>
forced to limit output. However, it should not be necessary for Australia<br>
to contemplate restriction of production during the course of the<br>
agreement. "" In selecting a price range many bases were considered,' but rather<br>
early in the negotiations-in 1941-42, in fact-Canadian sales were<br>
adopted as a basis, with equivalents to be worked out for Australian<br>
and United States sales. Although this basis was reviewed at different<br>
times, it was ultimately adopted. The views of Australia in regard to<br>
the treatment of sales to ' nearly markets were accepted and given<br>
effect in the formula set out ini the agreement. This formula means, in </p>
<p>A. i? 27<br>
effect, that in. sales for delivery to Britain when prices are at the top of<br>
Sthe range, Australia will charge the same c. i. f. as Canada, subject to<br>
any agreement for a difference on account of quality between Canadian<br>
and Australian wheat. As freight between Australia and Britain is<br>
greater than that between Canada and Britain, on the same c. i. f. price<br>
Australia would get a lower f. o. b. return than Canada.. On present<br>
freights, Canada would receive the maximum of 2 dollars or 12s.<br>
Australian, and Australia would receive 12s. The same price would<br>
apply to such European countries as Holland, Belgium and France.<br>
We might call this category A.<br>
"" In the case of India, and the British purchases for delivery to<br>
Ceylon and Malaya, the Canadian c. i. f. price would be much higher<br>
than the Australian consequently, when the Canadian f. o. b.<br>
equivalent was the basic price of 2 dollars ( 12s. the Australian<br>
f. o. b. equivalent would be much higher-perhaps 14s. 5d. In this case,<br>
under the agreed formula, Australia will charge 12s. 5d., the basic f. o. b.<br>
maximum. Canada cannot compete in these ' nearby markets' because<br>
its c. i. f. quote would be much higher than the c. i. f. equivalent of<br>
Australia's 12s, 5d. Thus, in; sales to these countries Australia's maximum<br>
f. o. b. price will be a straight conversion from the Canadian fLo. b.<br>
to the same figure in Australian currency. This group of countries<br>
might be called category B.<br>
It follows that, over the whole of our exports, the return Australia<br>
will get on exports under the agreement will depend on the proportion of<br>
category A to category B. A fair estimate is one -third A and two-third<br>
B. On present freight charges and rates of exchange, this would give<br>
12s. 3d. as an equivalent of the 2 dollars. If a quality differential of,<br>
say, 6d. were agreed to in the case of sales to Britain-there will -be no<br>
quality differential for sales to nearby countries-the average would be<br>
about 12s. In the case of the minimum, much the same principles will<br>
apply, although in certain circumstances the Australian f. o. b. price<br>
for sales to ' nearby markets' would come down to the minimum f. o. b.<br>
price for sales to Britain.<br>
"" In the case of markets equidistant from Canada and Australia-<br>
Shanghai for example, when Canada is shipping out of Vancouver-it<br>
would be necessary for us to be able t&amp; come down to such a price in<br>
order to compete with Canada on a c. i. f. basis in those markets. However,<br>
where countries such as India, New Zealand, Java, Ceylon and<br>
Malaya want wheat, or flour, they will naturally come to Australia for<br>
it and pay the Canadian f. o. b. prices-converted, of course, to Australian<br>
currency. Here, again, the actual minimum return overall<br>
would depend on the proportions of the 85,000,000 bushels that go to the<br>
different destinations. A fair estimate would be that, if prices fel<br>
heavily and reached the minimum of 1 dollar 20 cents throughout the<br>
fourth year, the average return would be about 7s., and that, if they<br>
went to the minimum of I dollar 10 cents in the fifth year, the average<br>
return would be about 6s. 4d. The calculations which have been used in<br>
arriving at these figures are conservative. ' I<br>
9! </p>
<p>28<br>
"" Alterations of freight rates would affect sales in category A. If'<br>
freights fell, our f. o. b. return would increase. If they rose, the reverse<br>
would be the case. Alterations in exchange would also affect these<br>
equivalents if such alterations affected the relationship between Australian<br>
currency and the Canadian dollar. A special clause in the<br>
agreement provides that, if the Canadian dollar depreciates on the<br>
American dollar, there will be no change in the basic prices.<br>
"" There is no commitment under the agreement that wheat shall -bepreferred<br>
to flour. In practice, Australian mills should be able to sell<br>
their full output. The British allotment under the agreement covers<br>
flour for Britain, Ceylon, Malaya and British commitments in respect<br>
of other colonies. The Netherlands quota inceludes flour for the Netherlands<br>
East Indies. These, with the requirements of the Pacific Islands,<br>
should keep our mills going.<br>
"" It is true, of course, that in the first year Australian growers will<br>
make a monetary sacrifice; they will receive less under the agreemient<br>
than if there were no agreemeut. This position might obtain also in<br>
the second year. It could even continue further. As time goes on,<br>
however, the risks the grower takes with no assured minimum become.<br>
greater. When the slump comes-and all close observers say it will<br>
come sooner or later-the consumer will be the loser and the producer<br>
will gain. But no one can say what the severity or duration of the<br>
slump will be. Summed up, the agreement seems to strike a fair balance<br>
between the early contributions of the producer and the later contributions<br>
of the consumer. However, with heavy crops in all wheat<br>
countries, it could be a real boon to the producer. To my mind, its real<br>
service to the Australian wheat-grower is that it gives him security.<br>
While enjoying good returns, he may look forward for five years-I<br>
personally hope the agreement will be reniewed long before the expiration<br>
of five years-with onlfidence-confidence that he will not have to<br>
face disastrous price falls such as the wheat-growers of Australia have<br>
experienced in past years."" [ The bill wuas passed.<br>

ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.<br>
AIRCRAFT CARRIERS.<br>
In Parliament.-On 26th April, 1948, the Minister for the Navy<br>
( Mr. Riord an) said-<br>
The overall plan announced by the Minister for Defence ( Mr.<br>
Dedman) on 4th June, 1947, envisaged the purchase by Australia of<br>
two aircraft carriers. The first of these ships will be commissioned in<br>
October, 1948, and will arrive in Australia early in 1949. The captain<br>
and some of the senior officers have already left Australia for England,<br>
where they arc doing certain courses. The remainder of the crew of<br>
600 will leave Australia in May, 1948, on Kanimbla, and will undergo<br>
certain training before the ship is commissioned. </p>
<p>29<br>
The Government still intends to Purchase the second aircraft car-<br>
7-ier, which should be commissioned towards the end of 1949 or in 1950.<br>
The reason why I cannot give any definite date at the moment is that<br>
-the Australian Government is endeavouring to have these aircraft carriers<br>
so constructed that they will be modern at the moment when they<br>
are commissioned. That is one of the reasons why the first aircraft<br>
carrier will not be commissioned on 24th June, 1948, as was first<br>
thought possible. I am not able to give the date or even the month<br>
when the second aircraft cardier will be commissioned, because modern<br>
improvements are being effected while the ship is being constructed.<br>
As to whether the armament will be obsolete, it was only recently<br>
that an order was placed for the purchase of aircraft. The reason for<br>
the delay was that the Australian Government wanted to be certain that<br>
these ships would be equipped with the most efficient and up-to-date<br>
aircraft available for service on a carrier. Jet-propelled aircraft may<br>
be issued to the American navy some time this year. We are now<br>
examining whether it is possible, even by a delay of a few months, to<br>
secure jet-propelled aircraft for the two ships.""<br>

ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.<br>
RESERVE.<br>
On 27th April, 1948, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford)<br>
. announccd conditions of the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve as<br>
follows: PERMANENT AIR FORCE RESERVE ( OR ACTIVE RESERVE).<br>
To conmprise personnel immediately available for mobilization in an emergency<br>
to bring existing unite to war strength * and to man additional units<br>
required on the outbreak of war.<br>
To be established, in the first instance, from personnel who have served dur-<br>
Ing World War 11. and able and willing to undertake such annual or periodic<br>
training as the Royal Australian Air Force might, from time to time, require.<br>
In the initial stages, training to be confined to alectures, films, and distribution<br>
of training pamphlets to be made available at centres. Subsequently, the reserve<br>
to be maintained primarily from personnel completing engagements in the permanent<br>
and citizen forces.<br>
Conditions of service to be engagement for five years and further re-engagements<br>
each of five years; applicants to volunteer for service andi be accepted<br>
for enlistment in the reserve, to possess honorable discharges; to be medically<br>
fit; and to report annually, notifying addresses or change of addresses, and<br>
other particulars required.<br>
Personnel appointed to the reservc to be appointed in the temporary rank<br>
previously held.<br>
Retirement from the reserve to be governed by the same retiring ages as<br>
applicable to the permanent air force. 0<br>
CITIZEN AIR FORCE RESERVE.<br>
To consist of personnel possessing qualifications required for service in the<br>
various branches of a modern air force.<br>
To be constituted initially from trained personnel, including the Royal Australian<br>
Air Force Nursing Service and the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air<br>
Force who served. during World War II.<br>
To be maintained partly fromi personnel trained in the active citizen air<br>
force, and partly from persons in civil life possessing qualifications required<br>
by the service. </p>
<p>Personnel not to be obliged to undertake any form of annual training butto<br>
be required to give an undertaking that, in the event of a national emergency,<br>
their services to be readily available to the Royal Australian Air Force..<br>
Conditions Of service to be: Volunteers with previous service to be entered<br>
It in their last substantive or higaher temporary rank; no time qualification in<br>
I regard-to service, and personnel might withdraw on giving due notice; personnel<br>
to be retired at the equivalent retiring ages for the p~ rmanent force;<br>
persons desiring to enrol must undertake to report for duty when called on<br>
in an emergency.<br>

announced that Dr. F. K. Norris had been appointed Director-General<br>
of Medical Services. MIGRATION.<br>
GOVERNMENT POLICY-BRITISH MIGRANTS.<br>
On 29th April, 1948, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Caiwell)<br>
said-The ' open door' of Australia is no empty phrase when applied to<br>
our kinsfolk from the British Isles. The Oovernment and the people<br>
of Australia are determined to preserve the predominantly British<br>
character of the Australian nation -by insisting that the highest possible<br>
proportion of our population gain through immigration should be from<br>
Britain. Australia's immigration figures for 1947 show that the number<br>
of Britishers who came to Australia was twenty times as great as that<br>
from the next highest source ( America), and three times as great as<br>
that from all other world sources put together. Of 31,950 new arrivals<br>
in 1947, Australia received 23,499 from Britain, 1,137 from the United<br>
States, 843 from displaced persons camps in Europe, and 6,471 from<br>
all other sources. This three to one overall ratio in favour of British<br>
migrants will be maintained.<br>
Would-be migrants in Britain may be assured that, wherever the<br>
Australian Government has any influence in the allocation of berths on<br>
ships ailing from Britain, no foreign national will be granted a passage<br>
at the expense of a waiting Britisher. No ships that can be obtained<br>
by the Australian Government will be allocated to the carriage of<br>
non-British migrants while British migrants await transport.""<br>
RUSSIA.<br>
EXCHANGE OF AMBASSADORS.<br>
On 30th April, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)<br>
announced that the first Soviet Ambassador to Australia would be<br>
Mr. N. M. ifanov and the first Australian Ambassador to Russia<br>
would be Mr. A. Watt. The appointments wvere in accordance with </p>
<p>the recent mutual agreement between the Australian and Soviet Governments<br>
to raise the status of their legations at Canberra and Moscow<br>
to that of embassies.<br>
Similar exchanges had been agreed to with France and China and<br>
when those appointments were completed, Australia would be represented<br>
on an ambassadorial level in the countries of all permanent<br>
members of the United Nations Security Council.<br>

PROPOSED CONFERENCE.<br>
In Parliament.-On 30th April, 1948, the Prime -Minister ( Mr.<br>
Chifley) said-<br>
No suggestion, either official or unofficial, has been made that a<br>
conference of Empire Prime Ministers should be held. I realize, of<br>
course, that on the economic side a very grave position has developed.<br>
I realize how delicate is the position, and that it affects not only<br>
Britain but ourselves and other countries with which Britain is associated.<br>
It may be necessary for me or some other Minister conversant<br>
with the economic aspects of the affairs of the Empire to visit London;<br>

SOCIAL SECURITY.<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICE-MINISTER'S BROADCAST.<br>
On 2nd May, 1948, the ' Minister for Health ( Senator Mc~ enna)<br>
broadcast over the national network. Senator McKenna said-<br>
"" In 1947, the Government repealed acts of 1944 * and 1945, and<br>
passed an entirely new act to enable pharmaceutical benefits to be<br>
provided. Since then the Government has concluded discussions with<br>
the Federal Council of the British Medical Association, the Federated<br>
Pharmaceutical Service Guild, the Friendly Societies Dispensaries and<br>
nearly all States.<br>
Administrative arrangements bave been completed and regulations<br>
under the act will come into force within the next few days. The<br>
scheme will come into operation on 1st June, 1948.<br>
The ' benefits are listed in the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical<br>
formulary which will be published in book form. The Government<br>
had at its disposal in the preparation of the formulary the best specialist<br>
advice from the medical, pharmaceutical and pharmacological fields.<br>
The benefits in-clude such modern drugs as those of the ' sulpha' group,<br>
preparations of penicillin, vaccines, serums, anti-toxins and other<br>
biological products such as insulin, The range of medication covered<br>
by the. formulary includes preparations. nder more than 40 headings<br>
ranging from ear, eye and nose drops to, children's requirements, </p>
<p>32<br>
vit-amin solutions and sundry medical materials and applications..<br>
Altogether, about 600 items are listed in formulary, but this gives<br>
no idea of its scope since provision has been made for ingredients of<br>
formulae to be omitted, reduced and in some cases increased. Provision<br>
has been-made for certain drugs to be added to mixtures and.<br>
other preparations. These provisions give great flexibility to the<br>
formulary and permit of so many variations as to extend its range to.<br>
hundreds of thousands of prescriptions.<br>
"" These benefits can be made available only on ' a prescription<br>
written by a registered medical practitioner. The Government feels<br>
that, having regard to the high standards of the medical profession,.<br>
the risk of unnecessary prescribing is negligible. This arrangement<br>
will provide a safeguard against unnecessary demands from patients,.<br>
since they must consult their doctors as a preliminary to receipt of<br>
pharmaceutical benefits.<br>
There is no compulsion of any kind upon a doctor to co-operate<br>
in the scheme. ' When a doctor does take part he is not bound in any<br>
way to confine his prescribing to the formulary. If there should be<br>
some particular drug or compound which he considers more appropriate<br>
to, his patient's need than any contained in the formulary then he<br>
will of course prescribe it, but in that case the patient himself must<br>
pay for the prescription, the Government accepting full responsibility<br>
for its omission from the formulary.<br>
After a doctor has studied the contents of the formulary and its<br>
flexibility I am sure that his decision regarding co-operation in the<br>
scheme will be determined by his medical judgment, his humanity<br>
and his good citzenship, and by no other consideration.<br>
The act provides for the establishment of a formulary committee.<br>
Its function will be to advise on the revision of the formuilary in the<br>
light of experience, and of the latest developments in medical science.<br>
The Government provided in the 1947 act, at the request of the Federal<br>
Council of the British Medical Association, that the personnel of this<br>
committee should be predominantly medical in character. This constitutes<br>
one of the important points of difference between the original<br>
scheme and the one now about to be launched.<br>
"" A second point of difference lies in the fact that whereas in the.<br>
1944 scheme a penalty in the form of a fine, in default three months""<br>
imprisonment, was imposed for doctors who prescribed unnecessarily,<br>
this provision was wholly omitted from the 1947 act. This was done<br>
at the request of the Federal Council of the British Medical Association.<br>
The regulations embody a code specifying what constitutes proper<br>
prescribing., This is based on a code submitted by the council. No<br>
penalty or sanction whatsoever for -breach of the code has been provided.<br>
The Government places its trust in the honour of the profession to<br>
observe the code and has intimated to the council that should theconduct<br>
of some few medical practitioners demonstrate the need for<br>
something of that nature it wvill consult the council as to the form of'<br>
sanction that would be appropriate. </p>
<p>33<br>
"" The patient's part in the scheme is very simple. Where his<br>
-doctor prescribes a pharmaceutical benefit he will hand the prescriptionto<br>
the patient in duplicate. The patient will then take the prescription<br>
to any approved chemist or approved friendly society dispensary. He<br>
will hand both copies -of the prescription to the pharmacist who will<br>
supply the benefit without charge to the patient. ' Where the doctor has<br>
ordered a prescription to be repeated, the patient will still hand both<br>
copies of the prescription to the pharmacist who, in addition to supplying<br>
the benefit will hand to him a repeat authorization form with the<br>
duplicate of the prescription; these documents will enable him to<br>
secure a repeat supply of the benefit from any -approved pharmacist.<br>
"" In chronic cases, for instance in the case of diabetics who are in<br>
constant need of insulin, a doctor may, at one consultation, prescribe a<br>
supply that will be adequate for up to 91 da~ a.<br>
Special provision has also been made to meet the plight of persons<br>
living in outback areas beyond the reach of the dispensing doctor or<br>
chemist. "" A doctor may prescribe a benefit without a Commonwealth form<br>
in any case of emergency -but is required to supply the prescription<br>
on -a proper form at a later date to enable the chemist supplying the<br>
benefit to collect payment from the Commonwealth.<br>
"" Where a chemist is asked to d * ispense a prescription after usual<br>
trading hours he is entitled to payement from the patient of a late<br>
fee of is. In the case of a prescription endorsed by a doctor as urgent'I<br>
the chemist is obliged to supply the benefit as soon as practicable<br>
provided the prescription is presented at the premises of the approved<br>
* chemist. Should it be necessary for the chemist to deliver any pharmaceutical<br>
benefit he may make a charge equal to the actual cost of the<br>
delivery. There is a prohibition against any doctor, chemist or hospital<br>
dispenser parting with possession of or destroying any of the official<br>
forms or publications issued to him except in accordance with the act.<br>
As these documents are the basis of entitlement to receipt of and<br>
payment for costly and dangerous drugs, this provision is essential for<br>
the security of the community and for the proper protection of Commonwealth<br>
funds.<br>
All medicines needed by a patient occupying a public' bed in a<br>
public ward are already provided for under the Commonwealth Hospital<br>
Benefits Scheme and do not come within the ambit of the act.<br>
Provision is being made by arrangement with the various States so<br>
that out-patients will receive pharmaceutical benefits without cha rge<br>
when the scheme comes into operation. Special arrangements will be<br>
made to meet the needs of patients in private hospitals or in inter-<br>
-mediate and private wards of public hospitals. These arrangements<br>
will vary according to whether the hospital has or has not a pharmacist<br>
on its premises.""~ </p>

WAR SERVICE MORATORIUM-EXTENSION.<br>
On 4th May, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" A discharged member of the forces remains a ' protected person'<br>
for three years after being discharged or ceasing to -be engaged on war<br>
service. The protection of female dependants and parents of discharged<br>
members of the forces also exists for a similar period of three years.<br>
The period was originally six months but was increased from time to<br>
time so that it is now three years.. In many cases the three years'<br>
period from discharge has recently expired or will expire in the near<br>
future, and, unless the period is extended, there may be a considerable<br>
number of evictions of ex-servicemen.<br>
"" The Re-establishment and Employment Act provides that land<br>
owned by a member of the forces shall not be required compulsorily<br>
without the prior consent of the Attorney-General. The Act provided<br>
that the protection afforded should continue for a period of twelve<br>
months after the date of discharge of the number or the period of the<br>
length of the member's service whichever was the shorter period. As a<br>
result of representations made last year by various organizations of<br>
ex-servicemen, the period of twelve months was extended to two years,<br>
so that ex-servi-cemen might not be deprived of land on which they<br>
L_ 2 </p>
<p>hoped to , build homes. In view of the present building difficulties, the<br>
Direetor , of the Legal Service Bureau has expressed the opinion that it<br>
is desirable to extend the period of protection . from two years to three<br>
years. Representations have also been made by organizations of exservicemen<br>
to the same effect.<br>
Cabinet to-day decided that the period of protection under the<br>
War Service Moratorium Regulations to discharged members of the<br>

PERMANENT FORCES-RETIREMENT SCHEME, BILL<br>
INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.--On 5th . May, 1948, the Minister for Defence :( Mr.<br>
D. edman) introduced the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Bill. Mr.<br>
Dedman said-<br>
The bill proposes to establish a scheme for improved retirement<br>
benefits on a uniform basis for members of the Permanent Defence<br>
Forces. The existing provisions for retirement benefits -are deficient.<br>
In particular, they lack uniformity as between the three services. ' This<br>
is no longer justifiable since comparable standards of pay and -service<br>
conditions have been provided for all three services. Moreover, it<br>
would be impossible under the existing retirement provision to deal<br>
adequately with the peculiarly difficult problem created by the practice,<br>
now common to all services, of retirement at comparatively early ages.<br>
Early retirement of members of the forces has been made necessary by<br>
the requirements of a modern defence system. It is now the rule in the<br>
British armed forces and the other British Commonwealth countries.<br>
In view of our special needs for defence forces of the highest efficiency<br>
under conditions of present warfare, we cannot afford to lag behind in<br>
this vital matter.<br>
Nevertheless, the practice creates a problem which is intensely<br>
human, and has an important practical bearing on our ability to recruit<br>
and retain men of the requisite calibre for the services. The practice<br>
means that men will in many cases come to the end of their service<br>
careers while still in the early middle years of their lives. In the Air<br>
Force, retirement of officers commence at the age of 41, in the Navy, at<br>
the age of 45 and, in the Army, at the age of 47. Men who leave the<br>
services at such ages have before them the acute personal problem of<br>
finding new occupations in civil life. Since the exigencies of the defence<br>
system impose these conditions of retirement, the Government has a<br>
clear obligation to provide a special scheme of retiring benefits, which<br>
should be sufficient to tide the member over the period of readjustment<br>
and to supplement substantially his earnings in his civil occupation.<br>
Similar considerations apply into a perhaps somewhat lesser degree to ii </p>
<p>S 36<br>
I: men who retire from more senior service positions at a rather higher<br>
but still relatively early age. On the practical side, it has to be<br>
considered that unless provision of this kind is made, the prospect of<br>
early retirement will act as a discouragement to men contemplating<br>
careers in the services.<br>
"" I outline existing retirement provisions for the forces. Naval<br>
personnel are credited with deferred pay, payable on the retirement<br>
of the member, or to his estate if death occurs during service. For<br>
officers serving to the full retiring age of their ranks, the cumulative<br>
deferred pay would amount to approximately œ 4,000 for lieutenantcommanders<br>
rising to approximately œ 6,500 for captains. Permanent<br>
personnel of Army are contributors to the Commonwealth Superannuation<br>
Fund and have the same pension cover for themselves and their<br>
dependants as have members of the Commonwealth Public Serv-ice.<br>
"" Before the amendment of the Superannuation Act in 1947, the<br>
maximum pension obtainable by any officer at the age of 60 was œ 416<br>
per annum. Under the amendments to the Superannuation Act, there<br>
was a general increase by 23 per cent. of the pensions of all officers and<br>
other ranks, and officers were enabled, according to their rate of salary,<br>
to contribute for a muaximum. pension of œ 345 per annum at the age of<br>
The general effect was that 60 per cent. -of the cost of all pensions<br>
would he provided by the Commonwealth. The Air Force provisions<br>
are not in line with those of either the Navy or the Army. Permanent<br>
Air Force personnel -below officer rank are contributors to the Superannuation<br>
Fund under -conditions similar to those obtaining in the Army.<br>
Air Force officers contribute to the Superannuation Fund to provide<br>
for benefits on death or invalidity during service. The major retirement<br>
provision for these officers is a system of deferred pay which is a<br>
benefit paid to the member on retirement or to his estate if death occurs<br>
during service. The rates of deferred pay are substantially less than<br>
those of Naval personnel of equivalent rank. The review of these<br>
provisions led to the following conclusions-<br>
First-Wide disparities exist between the different schemes.<br>
Secondly-In view of the recent red uction of retiring ages for Army officers<br>
from 55 or 60 to ages ranging fioin 47 years upwards, and even lower retiring<br>
ages in the other services, it is necessary to provide a scheme of pension for<br>
retirements at age 40 or later.<br>
Thirdly-A deferred pay scheme makes inadequate provision for the officer<br>
or his dependants in the event of death or invalidity in the early stage of his<br>
career. Fourtbly-Payn~ ent of deferred pay in a lunmp suni on retirement may lead<br>
to an unwise or unfortunate investment resulting-in the loss of the retirement<br>
benefit. Fifthly-Now that comparable ranks in each service receive generally the<br>
same rates of pay and allowances, it is most desirable that a uniform system of<br>
retirement benefits for all services should be adopted.<br>
"" An exhaustive investigation of all aspects of the problem was<br>
made, and recommendations subscribed to by representatives of the<br>
I. three service boards form the basis of the bill. </p>
<p>IIœ 3; The bi provides for a scale o: f pensions to officers rising from<br>
annum for majors, and equivalent ranks in the other services,<br>
up to a maximum of œ 845 per annum. for lieutenant-generals, and equivalent<br>
ranks in the other services, who serve until retirement at age<br>
The maximum pension of œ 845 is also the maximum pension payable<br>
to a member of the Commonwealth Public Service.<br>
"" The pension provision in the case of other ranks is based on<br>
twenty years' service after the age 0f twenty, and the rates range from<br>
per annum for able seamen, private or aircraftman, 1st class, to<br>
œ 155 per annuma for a chief artificer, warrant officer 1. ( Army) or<br>
warrant officer ( Air). For service beyond twenty years, the annual<br>
rate of pension increases by œ 6 to œ 8 for each additional year of completed<br>
service. Provision is made in the bill for the payment of a half<br>
pension to the widow, and allowances to the children, on lines similar to<br>
the Superannuation Act. After retirement of the member, the rate<br>
of widows' pension is related to the pension previously payable to the<br>
ex-member. "" The existing deferred pay and superannuation schemes cover only<br>
permanent members of the forces. This bill extends pension benefits to<br>
personnel on long-term engagements. Those who do not serve for a<br>
sufficient period to qualify for a pension will be entitled to a refund<br>
of their contributions if their period of service is less than ten years,<br>
although throughout this period they will be covered against death<br>
or invalidity. Where the term of service is in excess of ten years, but<br>
less than twenty years, the member will be entitled to a refund of his<br>
contribution, -plus a gratuity equal to one and a half times the amount<br>
he has contributed. Provision has been made for certain officers who,<br>
because of their late age on entry, cannot complete twenty years' service<br>
for pension before reaching the retiring age for the rank held, to receive<br>
a pension on a reduced scale after the completion of fifteen years' service.<br>
"" Naval, Army and Air Force cadets, and all personnel under the<br>
age of eighteen years, will be covered ' by the scheme, but will not be<br>
required to contribute to the fund until attaining the age of eighteen<br>
years. They will not be pensionable until reaching the age of 40 years.<br>
"" The existing deferred pay entitlements of Naval and Air Force<br>
members presented particularly difficult problems. These have been<br>
met by granting these members the option to become contributors to<br>
the Defence Forces Retirement Fund, or, alternatively, to retain their<br>
existing rights. The deferred pay of those members who elect to<br>
Ibecome contributors to the fund will be transferred to the new fund<br>
to be established under this act, and the amount so transferred will be<br>
used to reduce their future contributions for pension entitlement. Army<br>
personnel, who are contributors under the Superannuation Act, will be<br>
transferred to the new defence forces retirement scheme on the same<br>
trms and conditions as regard benefits and contibutions as those to<br>
which they are entitled under the Superannuation Act. The reserve<br>
values held on their behalf will be transferred from the Superannuation<br>
Fund to the new fund, and will be available to meet part of the cost </p>
<p>38<br>
of the benefits they will ultimately receive. The contributions of memhbers<br>
of the services will be precisely the same as in the case of the Commonwealth<br>
Public Scrvice, and relate to a member'sa rate of pay, and<br>
the age at which he becomes a contributor or obtains pay increases.<br>
"" To finance a scale of pensions such as is proposed for early retirements<br>
in the defence forces wvill entail a much greater government contribution<br>
than in the case of the Commonwealth Public Service superannuation<br>
scheme,' where retirements occur at age 60 or 65. The subsidy<br>
under the Superannuation Fund, namely, 60 per cent. of the cost<br>
of pensions, is inadequate for the retirement fund. On the average,<br>
because of early retirement benefits, the Commonwealth will have to<br>
pay much more than 60 per cent., but because of the impossibility of<br>
forecasting retirement rates, no precise statement can be made of what<br>
the percentage is likely to be. The Commonwealth undertakes to meet<br>
the deficiency between the value of benfits payable and the accumulated<br>
value of the members' contributions. The method followed is similar<br>
to that under the Superannuation Fund. The Commonwealth meets its<br>
liability in respect of each payment of pension or gratuity as it arises.<br>
"" No precise information is at present available as to the ultimate<br>
cost of the defence forces retirement scheme, but, based on the present<br>
approved strength of the forces, it is estimated that the annual commitment<br>
may reach œ 2,000,000 in fifteen years' time, and increase comparatively<br>
slowly thereafter. This commitment is much in excess of the<br>
present liability of the Commonwealth in respect of deferred pay andl<br>
superannuation for the forces.<br>
"" Provision is made to establish a defence forces retiremeut fund,<br>
administered by a board comprised of the president of the Commonwealth<br>
Superannuation Fund, the Commonwealth Actuary, a representative<br>
of the Treasury, and one from each of the three services. They<br>
will hold office for two years.<br>
"" The bill provides for the control and investmnent of the fund under<br>
the direction of the board along lines similar to those provided in the<br>
Superannuation Act. It also -provides that the fund shall be audited<br>
by the Commonwealth Auditor-General; that it shall be valued by the<br>
Commonwealth Actuary every five years, and that the annual report<br>
of the board's operations and a statement of accounts shall be published.<br>

CONSTITUTION.<br>
AMENDMENT-REFERENDUM, PRICES.<br>
On 10th May, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) broadcast<br>
over the national network. Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Fellow citizens,<br>
On Saturday, 29th May, you will be asked to record a simple vote,<br>
either Yes or No at a referendum to indicate whether the Australian<br>
Constitution should be amended to give the Commonwealth Parliament<br>
power to control rents and prices ( including charges).<br>
It is my purp ose to-night to put to you squarely the matter which<br>
you should take into consideration when making your decision.<br>
This is not a matter of politics. This is a matter which affects your<br>
pocket and the welfare of the people and, particularly, of the less<br>
favoured section of the people.<br>
First I will tell you why this referendum is being taken and, secondly,<br>
1 will indicate why the Government thinks that the only efficient method<br>
of operating price control is through the Federal % Government on a<br>
uniform'basis. Thirdly, Il will give you an indication of what I believe<br>
will happen if this referendum is not carried and it is held that the<br>
Commonwealth Government cannot exercise price control.<br>
As you know, price control was first exercised under the compelling<br>
necessity of war and the power was, and is still, exercised uinder the<br>
Defence powers of the Commonwealth. Price control was introduced<br>
because it was realized that rapidly rising prices would throw our<br>
economy completely out of gear and reduce our capacity to make a full<br>
war effort. Price control was then, and is now, a brake on inflation.<br>
The power, as I have mentioned, was exercised under the Defence<br>
power. That power is liable, because the war has ended, to be successfully<br>
challenged. Should such a successful challenge be made, the<br>
whole price-fixing structure would vanish and the people would imme.-<br>
diately be at the mercy of those who are prepared to charge any price<br>
for goods in short supply. To say that the States could pick up the<br>
task of fixing prices is a deliberate attempt to mislead you. The States<br>
have neither the staff, the experience, nor the machinery to undertake<br>
this task. In fact, only two have legislation on the subject.<br>
It was realized after the cessation of hostilities that the price firing<br>
power which was operated under Commonwealth control could be in<br>
danger. Consultations were held with the State Premiers-comp rising both<br>
Labour and conservative Premiers. They agreed unanimously that it<br>
was necessary to continue ' price control. They were anxious to avoid<br>
the ' boom and bust' policy which followed World War IL and which<br>
caused so much unemployment, misery, hardship and degradation in<br>
this country. </p>
<p>In 1946, the Premiers unanimously agreed-subject to their parliaments'<br>
concurrence-to pass legislation which would enable price control<br>
powers to be exercised -by the Commonwealth Government for as long<br>
as shortages of commodities persisted. But hostile legislative councils--<br>
bodies not elected by the people--blocked that effort in some of the<br>
States. Here, briefly, is what h-appened to the Economic Stability<br>
Bill in the various State parliaments-<br>
New South Wales.-The act expires on 31st December next.<br>
Victoria.-The act expired last June, the Legislativ-e Council refusing to<br>
extend it past then.<br>
Queensland-The act continues until a date to be proclaimed.<br>
South Australia.-The act expired l-ast December.<br>
Western Australia.-The act expires next December.<br>
Tasmania-The act expires next month, the Legislative Council refusing to<br>
extend it beyond then.<br>
Without the concurrence of all State parliaments the promise was<br>
nullified. The Queensland and New South Wales Governments were<br>
prepared to give effect to this promise. I believe all the Premiers<br>
were prepared to carry out the promise they made but in some States<br>
the parliaments refused to endorse the promise. Had the States done<br>
their job and provided you with complete insurance -against rising<br>
prices and the grave danger of inflation there would have been no<br>
need for a referendum. Having-tried to give you protection in that<br>
way and failed, the Commonwealth Government is now faced with the<br>
national responsibility of asking you to give it the power to protect<br>
your interest and the national economy.<br>
H I now-come to the second point. Any intelligent Australian will<br>
realize that price control must be operated on a Commonwealth basis<br>
if there is to be uniformity. To have six price-fixing authorities fixing<br>
prices on goods that are manufactured in one State and distributed<br>
into all the other States must appear to any thinking person as<br>
ludicrous. No effective control of prices can be exercised on prices<br>
of goods by a State when those goods have been brought from another<br>
State. A State would have no powver to investigate the cost of producing<br>
such goods. Here is another instance. If one State did not fix the<br>
price of a commodity in its cown State, any other State into which<br>
such a type of goods was sent would not have any guide as to what<br>
price should be fixed.<br>
I have already mentioned that, apart from this difficulty, the States<br>
have neither the experience nor the machinery to undertake the task.<br>
My third point is that if this referendum is not carried and the<br>
power now carried on under the Defence Power is successfully challenged,<br>
there can only be one result-inflationary prices and immediate<br>
demands -by workers for increased wages to overtake the increased cost<br>
of living. And out of all that would he chaos.<br>
There is another aspect of price control I place before you-an<br>
aspect vital in maintaining a stable economy. Without price control<br>
the Commonwealth Government could not continue fully its system<br>
of subsidies that is keeping down the price of a wide range of everyday<br>
commodities. The Commonwealth meets part of the cost of every </p>
<p>pound of butter, tea, potatoes and of every pint of milk purchased by<br>
the Australian consumer. The price of all Australian made woollen<br>
goads and most other items of clothing is much lower because of these<br>
subsidies. I give yrou a few examples of what these consumer subsidies mean<br>
to the family budget and living costs generally. If the Commonwealth<br>
Government were forced to abandon its subsidy plan, the price of tea<br>
would overnight rise by 2s. 6d. to 5s. 3d. per lb.; butter would go up<br>
by Sid. per lb.; milk by Jd. a quart and the price of potatoes would<br>
nearly double. An ordinary three-piece suit would cost another<br>
shoes would go up by 2s. a pair and those who prefer kid shoes would<br>
have to pay 6s. more a pair.<br>
The subsidy of œ 5,500,000 being paid on textiles other than wool is<br>
saving consumers about œ 8,000,000 a year on their clothing bill.-<br>
The farmer would have to pay nearly 50 per cent. more for his<br>
superphosphate. The Commonwealth Government is also paying subsidies on such<br>
items as coal -and coastal shipping freights. These are indirectly<br>
keeping down living costs.<br>
At present the Commonwealth is spending about œ 40,000,000 a year<br>
on these consumer subsidies. The Government has announced that its<br>
object is to remove or reduce many of these subsidies when circumnstances<br>
permit, but in a world of great economic difficulty and inflated<br>
prices, they are being retained for the time being to ease the burden<br>
of consumers. People must realize, however, that if the Commonwealth's power<br>
to control prices failed many of these subsidies would have to be<br>
terminated. The Commonwealth could scarcely accept a position in<br>
which State -authorities had control over the factors which determined<br>
the effectiveness or otherwise of Commonwealth subsidies costing more<br>
than œ C40,000,000 a year.<br>
Some -opponents of the Commonwealth's request that -you vote ' yes'<br>
on May 29th, try to make you believe that the States can themselves<br>
do the job when the Commonwealth's war-time powers run out.<br>
Any wise Australian will realize very quickly that price control<br>
must -be exercised on a Commonwealth-wide basis and could not be<br>
carried out effectively by individual States with separate and differing<br>
systems. As to the catch-cry about Canberra bureaucrats', Commonwealth<br>
price control is decentralized to such a degree that 90 per cent, of the<br>
decisions are made in the States; the whole work being co-ordinated<br>
by the Prices Commissioner at Canberra, where only 12 per cent. of the<br>
total prices staff is stationed. As a matter of interest, Commonwealth<br>
price control costs each Australian exactly one half-penny a week.<br>
I turn now to give you a warning-a warning of what can happen<br>
if Commonwealth control of prices ends. Unhappily, we have a firsthand<br>
example in what has occurred in the United States. </p>
<p>42<br>
I will now give you a picture in figures of what has happened since<br>
V. P. Day. In Australia, the price rise has gone from 22.86 per cent.<br>
on V. P. Day to 86 per cent, to-day. In Britain, where price control is<br>
maintained, the increase has been only from 80.4 per cent. on V. P.<br>
Day to 33.3 per cent. in December, 1947. But in Canada, where<br>
considerable decontrol has -been forced by the proximity of the United<br>
States, the rise has been from 19 per cent, to 42 per cent., and in<br>
the United States from 30 per cent. to the astonishing figure of 66<br>
per cent. Here is what happened in the United States:<br>
Price control, which had been effectively handled during the war<br>
years, was extended until 30th June, 1946. A clamnour was set up to<br>
abolish the system. President Truman decided to lift price control.<br>
In the following 25 days, food prices rose by 25 per cent!<br>
The President put controls back on July 25th, 1946, but pressure<br>
groups maintained their activity and in the following November all<br>
controls were lifted except those on rents, sugar and rice. Some of the<br>
actual price rises since price control lapsed are roast beef from 2s. 1d.<br>
per lb. to 4s. 2d. butter from 3s. 10d. per lb. to 5s. Sjd. cheese froin<br>
2s. 7d. per lb. to 4s. id.; -bacon from 2s. 7d. per lb. to 4s9. 1id.; eggs<br>
from 2s. lid, to 4s. 2d. a dozen.<br>
Food prices in the United States in December last year were 118<br>
per cent. higher than in September, 1930-more than double.<br>
In this talk, I have explained why the referendum on 29th May<br>
became necessary. I have shown that the States cannot, of themselves,<br>
provide Australia with an efficient system. The dangers confronting<br>
Australia have been clearly put to yrou.<br>
I now give you the same assurance as was given to the Australian<br>
Parliament when the bill to enable this referendum to be held was<br>
introduced in November last. The Government does not consider that<br>
it will be necessary to operate price control indefinitely, or to operate<br>
it in the detailed arid complete form to which we have become<br>
accustomed in recent years. Price control is that form is necessary<br>
only in a period of general excess of demand over supply; a condition<br>
which is being steadily removed. As shortages disappear, so can price<br>
control disappear until it will become a reserve power, operating only<br>
when and where it is for the well-being of the national economy.<br>
It would -be utterly impossible for the Federal Government, once<br>
given this direct power to control prices, to use that power to socialize<br>
anything-as is being alleged by anti-price control elements, flow<br>
could price control be used to socialize industry? Only by fixing unpayable<br>
prices which would drive private enterprise out of production.<br>
What then? The Commonwealth Government cannot, under the Constitution,<br>
operate any form of primary or secondary production, except<br>
such things * as munitions and uniforms for its own use. It cannot<br>
engage generally in wholesale or retail trading. </p>
<p>43<br>
So far, in this talk with you, I have dealt almost entirely with<br>
prices as such. Included in the question upon which you are asked to<br>
vote Yes or No on 29th May, is Commonwealth control of rents<br>
and charges.<br>
The power over rents would cover the fixing or pegging of rents<br>
and would include power to provide for the determination of fair<br>
rents and to protect tenants against eviction.<br>
The power would -also apply to rents of goods as well as rents of<br>
land and buildings. It would enable the Commonwealth Parliament<br>
to control and regulate the prices at which property of any kind, including<br>
commodities, are sold.<br>
Charges are specifically mentioned as included in prices to remove<br>
any doubt about charges which are in the nature of prices or rents, but,<br>
in relation to which, the term prices "" or "" rent may not be<br>
ordinarily used. Examples are the charges for hairdressing or for<br>
board and lodging. Another example would be the charges for the<br>
use of money, or in other wards, interest.<br>
It may be said that the State Governments could control rents.<br>
But it is unlikely that the States would do so at the same time and in<br>
the same way. That was the case after World War I. Under Commonwealth<br>
control, rents rose only 1 per cent. between 1914 and 1918.<br>
But after World War I. ended and Commonwealth control ceased,<br>
rents went up by nearly 50 per cent. -between 1918 and 1929. The<br>
States did not control rents then and it is dangerous to risk another<br>
failure by the States now.<br>
In any event, if rents were allowed to rise in one State, but not in<br>
others, wages would rise in that State above the general level. With<br>
wages, many other costs and prices would rise as well. As a result, the<br>
whole Australian economy would be thrown off balance. In practical<br>
terms, in safe terms, unified control of rents can be secured only<br>
through the Commonwealth Parliament.<br>
I will deal with one other misleading argument advanced by<br>
opponents of a Yes vote on 29th May. It is claimed that, if the<br>
referendum is carried, the Commonwealth would have power to fix<br>
wages and to conscript labour.<br>
The simple answer to that argument is that the Commonwealth has<br>
no industrial power under the Constitution and there is no possibility<br>
whatever that the High Court would regard power over prices<br>
as a power to regulate wages and employment.<br>
Throughout this talk, I have stressed that this. is a simple issue,<br>
arising because of the simple fact that the State Parliaments failed to<br>
carry out the Premiers' undertakings. This is not even a political<br>
issue. Party politics do not enter into it. The State Premiers who<br>
gave the undertaking I have mentioned were a mixture of Labour<br>
and anti-Labour leaders. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Menzies), </p>
<p>Ar<br>
it .44<br>
who is leader of the Liberal party in the Commonwealth Parliament,<br>
is pledged to Commonwealth control of prices. Here is what he said<br>
in giving you his policy at the last Commonwealth elections-<br>
We shall unhesitatingly maintain price control as a means of preventing<br>
inflation during the period in which production is inadequate to meet the demand<br>
for goods which arises from the enormously increased purchasing power of the<br>
people. Mr. Menzies went on to say-<br>
Leot me, speaking for the government which introduced price control within<br>
a week of the outbreak of war, give the lie to those whisperers who tell you that<br>
a Liberal victory will mean an upward leap -in prices. We stand for con-trolled<br>
prices. I make those two quotations to show you that Mr. Menzies and the<br>
Government are of one and the same mind on this question.<br>
I sound one warning note before closing. In the world to-day<br>
peace has yet to be won. The awful cost of war has not yet been aii<br>
The democracies face enormous problems; the peoples of the world who<br>
gave their all to win a little happiness, a better way of life, face grim<br>
prospects. Britain poured out all she had in a war to the bitter end.<br>
To-day, her economic wounds are still bleeding. Australia is determined<br>
to play her part as a member of the British Commonwealth<br>
in the economic struggle now going on. Australia cannot carry out<br>
her part if she be weakened internally. A breakdown in the Australian<br>
economy would be another setback for Britain. I ask you to maintain<br>
Australia's economic stability. I ask you to vote Yes"" on 29th May<br>
for your security; for the economic welfare of yourself and your<br>
children.<br>

<p>PEACE.<br>
-JAPAN-MINISTER'S STATEMENT, FEBRUARY, 1948.<br>
-On 3rd February, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br>
Evatt) said:<br>
"" Australia is concerned over the consequences following the breakdown<br>
in the Council of Foreign Ministers at London in December,<br>
1947, and the inability of the major Powers to reach an agreement<br>
on the European settlement. These consequences are far-reaching,<br>
and have serious repercussions on the whole United Nations Organization,<br>
which was established on the assumption that there would be<br>
early peace settlements and that the unanimity of the malor Powers<br>
would be continued after the wvar. Another adverse result is that the<br>
Japanese peace settlement is held up. Once again it is being<br>
demonstrated by somewhat bitter experience that in international<br>
affairs peace and justice are indivisible.<br>
"" The Australian Government believes in greater participation by<br>
all those countries which actually participated in war and made a<br>
substantial contribution to victory. It will be one of the main objects<br>
of the discussions to, see how such participation can be most appropriately<br>
effected in the interests of -world peace. Firsthand information<br>
on the general situation from the Australian missions abroad, together<br>
with the personal experience of the officers mentioned, should<br>
be of great assistance in defining the scope and methods of Australia's<br>
participation."" ( ror earlier references, please see No. 108, page 40; No. 124, page 26;<br>
No. 127, page 35; No. 129, page 9.)<br>
On 4th February, 1948, Dr. Evatt said:<br>
The Australian Government has kept the United States Government<br>
continuously informed of its views on the Japanese settlement and<br>
the procedure which should be followed in formulating the peace treaty.<br>
After the British Commonwealth Conference at Canberra in August,<br>
1947, I visited the United States and discussed Japan with President<br>
Truman, the Secretary of State ( Mr. Marshall) and other American<br>
leaders and officials. Further talks on Japan have taken place at<br>
Washington since my return.<br>
"" Throug-hout, the Australian Government has emphasized the need<br>
for a just and lasting peace based on the principles of the United<br>
Nations Charter and -contributing to the security and welfare of all<br>
the peoples of Eastern Asia and the Pacific. Australia has stressed<br>
the urgency of reaching a definite settlement-an urgency to which<br>
General MacArthuir and the Canberra Conference have also drawn<br>
attenltion. Australia, because of her war effort and her position in the<br>
Pacific, is entitled to be a party principal in these negotiations, and<br>
our constant consultations with the United States Government are an<br>
indication that our position has been recognized in the talks that have<br>
so far taken place. </p>
<p>"" The delay in formulating a treaty for Japan is most unsatisfactory.<br>
The uncertainty as to the future of Japan is impeding the<br>
attainment of stability in the Far East, and preventing the formation<br>
of long-term plans by the countries of that area, including Australia.<br>
The chief disagreement concerns the membership and system of voting<br>
for the -peace conference. But the broad lines of the settlement itself<br>
have been indicated by the agreements made at Cairo, Yalta and<br>
Potsdam, and by the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission.<br>
Therefore, the Australian Government does not accept the present<br>
impasse as being in dny way final, and is taking every practicable<br>
diplomatic step to overcome the deadlock and bring -about a conference<br>
that will secure the agreement of all Powers which contributed<br>
directly to the defeat of Japan.""<br>
JAPAN-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT, FEBRUARY,<br>
1948.<br>
Ine Parliament.-On 19th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br>
Chifley) said:<br>
"" I regret that is not possible to announce a date for the assembling<br>
of the conference to draw up the Japanese peace treaty. A deadlock<br>
has been reached in regard to this matter. I believe that the Soviet<br>
Government takes the view that the treaty should be dealt with in the<br>
first place by the foreign ministers of the four major Powers. Of<br>
course, that is not acceptable to Australia, and I believe that it is not<br>
acceptable to a number of other nations. It is generally considered<br>
that all nations which participated in the war against Japan in the<br>
Pacific area should take part in the peace conference. Every endeavour<br>
has been made to over-come the present deadlock, but I -cannot say<br>
xhether the suggestions made are acceptable or not.""<br>
AUSTRALIAN POLICY-MINISTER'S STATEMENT,<br>
MARCH, 1948.<br>
On 21st March, 1948, Dr. Evatt said:<br>
"" The present situation can be described only as a ' drift' towards<br>
war. In other words, no one wants war, no one can afford to suffer the<br>
further losses of war and reduce living conditions even further-yet<br>
nations can ' drift' to war. It is almost as though nations were<br>
inanimate objects being carried inevitably down a stream, instead of<br>
being human beings, with feelings, hopes and ideal;, with full control<br>
through their responsible leaders of their destiny. The present condition<br>
of drift is, therefore, a challenge to all responsible leaders. War<br>
can come only as a result of absence of leadership in world affairs.<br>
The United Nations is the main hope for peace and improved<br>
living conditions throughout the world. The best positive help citizens<br>
of goodwill can give in world affairs to-day is to throw their weight<br>
behind the United Nations. The United Nations has its faults of<br>
1860-2 </p>
<p>procedure; but attacks made upon it now are reminescent of attacks<br>
made on the League of Nations by those who found it expedient to<br>
side-step the League and act independently of it, -and who contributed<br>
to its weakening and to World War II.<br>
The peoples of the world are entitled to a peace-a peace based<br>
on justice. It is sheer defeatism to accept the pessimistic and sometimes<br>
evil prognostications of those who light-heartedly anticipate a<br>
third world war and the consequent destruction of civilization. Loyal<br>
and consistent support for the United Nations offers a way out, providing<br>
its machinery is employed to achieve settlements based on justice<br>
and not on power. Australia has always taken, and will continue to<br>
take, a lead in advocating this view. The United Nations, and it alone,<br>
can arrest the drift towards war. This drift is now being welcomed<br>
by the deadly enemies of the Allies of the war not yet concluded by<br>
peace treaties-the open and secret followers of Ritlerism and<br>
Fascism. Nothing that can be done should be left undone so far as Australia<br>
is concerned to prevent the utter catastrophe of another war. The<br>
people of Australia who still suffer from the terrible losses of human<br>
life of World W-ar II., who still remember the cruel anxieties and fears<br>
which accompanied the war, and who are now successfully restoring<br>
in an economy of full employment the human and material losses of<br>
the war, will welcome the constitution of a National Committee for<br>
the United Nations in Australia, for it is only through the United<br>
Nations that peace can be achieved.<br>
There is no problem or dispute in the world which -cannot be<br>
settled in terms of peace and justice. But the way to settlement is<br>
through the United Nations, and not along the lines of power politics,<br>
w. hich have no regard to the facts and justice of each dispute. We<br>
rmust, at all costs, arrest the drift towards war, which is wanted by no<br>
responsible human being in the world. In this high endeavour, Australia<br>
and Australians can take as prominent a part as they did in the<br>
long and still unfinished fight against Hitlerism and Fascism.""<br>

<p>PERMANENT FORGES-RETIREMENT SCHEME.<br>
On 16th March, 1948, the Minister for Defence ( Mr. Dedman)<br>
said-"" Cabinet decided to-day that legislation be prepared for submission<br>
to the Federal Parliamentary Labour party to provide a<br>
uniform scheme of retirement benefits for members of the permanent<br>
naval, military and air forces.<br>
"" At present, the retirement provisions for the permanent forces<br>
differ in the respective service, the provision for naval personnel and<br>
air force officers being a system of deferred pay, while airmen below<br>
commissioned rank and members of the permanent military forces contribute<br>
to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. The deferred pay<br>
system has unsatisfactory features, particularly in that it makes inadequate<br>
provision for a member's dependants in the event of death or<br>
invalidity. The recent reduction of the retiring ages of army officers<br>
renders the public service superannuation scheme inappropriate for<br>
application in their case.<br>
In the formulation of the proposed uniform retirement scheme<br>
regard has been paid to the retirement benefits provided for the forces<br>
of Britain and other Dominions.<br>
The scheme will be contributory, providing a rate of pension<br>
appropriate to each rank. Pensions will be payable on retirement or<br>
discharge, subject to the member's having completed not less than<br>
twenty years' service after age twenty and, in the case of officers, to the<br>
member's having reached the retiring age of his particular rank. To<br>
cater for officers who enter the services some years later than the normal<br>
ages of entry, pensions at reduced rates will be provided for officers who<br>
reach the retiring age for their rank after completing at least fifteen<br>
years but less than twenty years' service. Officers with ten years, but<br>
less than fifteen years' service, from age twenty on retirement or discharge<br>
will receive a refund of their contributions to the fund, plus a<br>
gratuity equal to 150 per cent, of their contributions. The scale of<br>
contributions will be same as under the Commonwealth Public Service<br>
Superannuation Scheme, and the maximum pension will also be the<br>
same. "" The proposed scale of retirement pensions for officers ranges from<br>
œ. 275 a year for an army captain and equivalent navy and air force<br>
ranks retiring at or about age 45 to œ E845 a year for a lieutenantgeneral<br>
and equivalent ranks retiring at age 60. The basic pensions<br>
proposed for members below commissioned rank who are discharged<br>
after age 40 after serving not less than twenty years range from<br>
a year for a private -and equivalent navy and air force ranks, to œ 155<br>
a year for a Warrant Officer, Class and equivalent ranks. Additional<br>
amounts of pension ( from œ 6 a year for private to œ 8 a year for<br>
warrant officer will be provided for each year of service beyond<br>
twenty years' service for pension after age twenty, under definite<br>
engagement. Pensions for naval warrant officers and officers commissioned<br>
from warrant rank, and for army quartermasters, will range </p>
<p>from œ 300 a year for warrant officer ( navy) and lieutenant and quartermaster<br>
( army), to œ 450 a year for lieutenant-commander ex-warrant<br>
officer ( navy) and major and quartermaster ( army). The pension for<br>
a naval commander ex-warrant officer wvill be œ 550 a year. Due to the<br>
early retiring ages of members of the services as compared with civil<br>
servants, payment of the pensions proposed will involve a substantially'<br>
greater Commonwealth subsidy than is required in the case of the public<br>
service superannuation scheme.<br>
"" The scheme provides that a member below commissioned -rank<br>
who is not re-enlisted ou completion of his current engagement and who<br>
has not qualified for pension will receive a refund of -his contribution<br>
to the fund, plus a gratuity equal to 150 per cent. of the refund. The<br>
gratuity will not be less than a sum calculated at the rate of œ 30 for<br>
each completed year of service, subject to a proviso that the gratuity<br>
payable to a member who retires before completion of twelve years'<br>
service shall not exceed œ 120.<br>
The scheme provides that where a member dies in the service, his<br>
widow will receive one-half of the full pension which would be payable<br>
at age 60 in respect of the contributions being paid by the member<br>
prior to his death. On the death of a pensioned member, his widow<br>
will receive a pension at one-half the rate which was paid to the<br>
pensioner while alive. In cases of total permanent incapacity, it is<br>
proposed that the member will receive a pension on the same basis as<br>
would be payable in such circumstances to a contributor to the Commonwealth<br>
Superannuation Fund. Where the degree of incapacity is<br>
less than 60 per cent, benefits will be adjusted accordingly.<br>
"" It is proposed that all future appointees or enlistees to the<br>
permanent forces ( except other ranks, initially engaged for less than<br>
six years) will be compulsory contributors to the Defence Forces Retirement<br>
Fund. Members already contributing to the Commonwealth<br>
Superannuation Fund will transfer their existing rights to the Defence<br>
Forces Retirement Fund. Deferred pay standing to the credit of members<br>
of the naval forces and air force oficers will be utilized to purchase<br>
full units of pension, and such members will contribute for the balance<br>
of unit elements appropriate to the pay received. In the case of<br>
present serving members of naval and air forces who may consider that<br>
the existing deferred pay scheme is more advantageous may, at their<br>
option, stay out of the scheme and accept one of the following<br>
alternatives: To retain deferred pay at p~ resent at credit: this amiount to he paid with<br>
interest at 31 per cent, on death or retirement. Member to contribute for<br>
additional unit elements not covered by deferred pay and to receive ro rata<br>
benefits only.<br>
To continue uinder existing deferred pay scheme and make no contributions<br>
to the Defence Forces Retirement Fuind.<br>
"" The advantages of the new scheme are so substantial that it is<br>
anticipated that most members will elect to participate in it.<br>
"" Eligibility for full pension rights under the proposed scheme will<br>
be subject to the member agreeing, if required by the service, to serve<br>
on the reserve list maintained by the service of which he was a member.<br>
1860-3 </p>
<p>"" The scheme now approved has been framed having regard to the<br>
necessity of providing attractive conditions of service in all ranks, and<br>
should ensure that those who makc service in the armed forces their<br>
career are adequately provided for when their term of service has heen<br>
completed."" CITIZEN MILITARY FORCE S-CONDITIONS.<br>
On 5th March, 1948, Mr. Chambers announced conditions of service<br>
for officers and other ranks of the Citizen Military Forces. Officers<br>
would he selected firstly from those who were on the reserve of officers<br>
and who served during World War II., secondly from persons who<br>
served as other ranks during World War II., and in the case of<br>
technical arms and services, from persons who possessed the necessary<br>
civilian professional, technical or academic qualifications. An officer<br>
appointed from the reserve of officers would he permitted to accept an<br>
appointment in the Citizen Military Forces in a rank lower than that<br>
held by him on the reserve. Other ranks would he enlisted hetween<br>
the ages of 18 and 35 for the Citizen Military Forces field force, and<br>
between the ages of 18 and 45 for Citizen Military Forces fixed establishiments<br>
on the mainland; the ages of discharge being 40 and 48<br>
respectively. INDUSTRIAL.<br>
UNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.<br>
On 4th February, 1948, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)<br>
said that at 31st December, 1947, unfilled vacancies held by the Commionwealth<br>
Employment Service numbered 43,000 for males and 30,000<br>
for females, compared with 90,900 at 30th November, 1947. Recipients<br>
of unemployment benefits were 2,797 males and 68 females. During<br>
December, the Commonwealth Employment Service had referred<br>
14,500 males and 4,800 females to employers, and had given advice<br>
and information on various matters to 23,600 males and 5,400 females.<br>
On 7th February, 1948, Mr. Holloway said that at 31st January,<br>
1948, 3,823 males and 118 females were in receipt of unemployment<br>
benefit or re-employment allowance. The total was nearly 1,100 higher<br>
than that recorded at December, 1947, but the rise was more than<br>
aecounted for by the normal seasonal movement in Queensland.<br>
At 31st January, 1948, unfilled vacancies held by the Commonwealth<br>
Employment Service numbered 55,300 for males and 36,900 for females.<br>
The total was 19,200 greater than at December, 1947.<br>
NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES.<br>
POLICY-MEDIATION.<br>
On 4th February, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br>
Evatt) said-<br>
"" Following the recent truce agreement, negotiations between the<br>
Dutch and Indonesians are continuing, but no result will be announced<br>
until after the Committee of Good Offices has reported to the Security </p>
<p>Council. The conmittee has arrived at -New York. It is possible that<br>
the council, after considering the report, will ask the committee to<br>
remain in the Netherlands East Indies for a further period.<br>
The sending, of fourteen Australian military officers to Java is to<br>
assist in the carrying cut of the cease fire plan which includes an<br>
agreement for the demilitarization of a certain area between areas held<br>
by the Dutch and indonesian forces. The committee has called on the<br>
Governments of Belgium, the United States and Australia to supply<br>
personnel to carry out the dctails of the plan. The main task is to I<br>
supervise the transfer of certain groups of Indonesian troops through<br>
the demilitarized zone to their own area. The officers will be carrying<br>
out a non-military function, but it is thought preferable to use military<br>
men for such a task.<br>
"" Relations of the Australian representatives in Java with both the<br>
Dutch and Indonesians arc excellent and Dutch Government representatives<br>
at The Hague and Indonesian leaders have expressed appreciation<br>
of their work<br>

BANKING CONTROL.<br>
LEGISLAT1ON-NATIONALIZATION, COURT REARING.<br>
On 7th February, 194S, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" In view of the importance of the Banking Act case before the High<br>
Court of Australia. the A ttorney-Gen eral ( Dr. Evatt) will lead for the<br>
Commonwealth and the other defendants. Dr. Evatt and the Solicitor-<br>
General ( Professor K. H. Bailey) will appear in their official capacities<br>
for the defendants PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br>
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-LONG-TERM CONTRACTS, EGGS,<br>
EXTENSION.<br>
On 9th February, 194S, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard)<br>
announced that an agreement had been reached between the British<br>
Ministry of Food and the Commonwealth for the purchase of Australian<br>
eggs in shell, frozen egg pulp, and egg, powder. The existing contract,<br>
which was to have been effective until 30th June, 1950, would terminate<br>
on 30th June, 1948, and the new contract would commence with the<br>
season 1948-49 and extend up to and including the season 1952-53.<br>
The new contract envisaged that yearly progressive increases in production<br>
and export should commence in .1948-49, the objective being to<br>
a-chieve an export target of 105,000,0,00 dozens a season, in all forms.<br>
In the event of Australian exports not expanding sufficiently to provide<br>
a total shipment during 1949-50 and 1950-51 of the equivalent of<br>
4,500,000 cases, the British Ministry would have the right to call in<br>
January, 1951, for a review or revision of the quantities which it was<br>
committed to accept from Australia for the balance of the contract<br>
period. </p>
<p>To achieve before 1952-53 the full increase in egg exports as desired<br>
by the British Ministry, Australian egg production must be increased<br>
from its present level of 124,000,000 dozen eggs a year to about<br>
180,000,000 dozen. That would mean an increase of 5,500,000 birds in<br>
poultry flocks by 1952-53.<br>
Prices to apply for 1948-49, 1949-50 and 1950-51 were-<br>
Eggs in shell: 2s. 4d. a dozen; frozen whole egg ( egg pulp) Is. 8.9d. a lb.;<br>
dried sugared egg: 5s. Id. a lb.; dried whole egg: 7s. a lb.<br>
( These prices are for the 15 lb. pack: and prices for heavier or lighter packs<br>
will be adjusted pro rata.)<br>
Prices for 1951-52 and 1953 would be determined by further negotiation<br>
not less than sixteen months before the season to which they applied<br>
-at the beginning of the hatching season, which would substantially<br>
determine the size of flocks for the season in question.<br>
Oiling of shell eggs for export had been proved beneficial, and all<br>
prices fixed for shell eggs included allowance to cover the cost of oil<br>
processing. Maximum possible quantities were to be processed in<br>
1948-49, and thereafter all eggs in shell would be oiled.<br>
Only eggs which had not been washed may be included in the shell<br>
egg pack. Packing of shell eggs must take place during the period 1st<br>
June to 24th December in each year.<br>
The British Ministry would be given first preference for all shell<br>
eggs of export quality packed in Australia in the weight grades acceptable-<br>
13 lb. to 17 lb. a long hundred-and Australian exports of shell<br>
eggs in those grades to destinations other than Britain during the<br>
period January to June in each year, shall not exceed 2j per cent. of<br>
Australia's shell egg shipments to Britain during the preceding June-<br>
December period.<br>
AGRICULTURAL . COUNCIL MEETING-DECISIONS.<br>
On 9th February, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)<br>
said that a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council had been<br>
held. Decisions were-<br>
BRlTISH FOOD MIssIoN.-Council adopted a report from the Standing Comimittee<br>
on Agriculture expressing the view that the possibility existed for an<br>
expansion of food production in the Commonwealth to the mutual benefit of<br>
Britain and Australia, and that all available resources necessary to achieve this<br>
objective should be devoted to it by Commonwealth and State authorities.<br>
Council, which would confer with members of the mission, accepted the committee's<br>
view that it may be necessary, after the detailed objectives of the<br>
ission had been clarified and its proposals further developed, to arrange a<br>
special meeting to consider measures required to achieve increased production.<br>
EXPORT OF FEED GRAIns.-Council considered the export of feed grains other<br>
than wheat ( oats, feed barley, sorghum, imaize, millets and rye), and was of<br>
opinion that they should be held in Australia in sufficient quantity to meet<br>
the reasonable demands of the live-stock industry. Council considered that<br>
export of established surpluses of such grains should be permitted and that each<br>
kind of coarse grains should make its contribution to the live-stock feeding<br>
programmes. Council was of the opinion that producers of those grains should<br>
have the opportunity to share in both the domestic and export markets. Council<br>
was of the opinion that the possibilities'he urgently examined of setting up a<br>
coarse grains export authority to ensure equitable treatment to the individual<br>
States and to producers of the various types of coarse grains in relation to the<br>
exportation of those grains from the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>TOBACCO PRODUCrTIN.-Council considered the urgent necessity to increase<br>
production of tobacco leaf in Australia, in view of limitations imposed on the<br>
importation of tobacco from dollar areas. Council recommended that further<br>
consultations take place between Commonwealth and State representatives and<br>
technical officers to evolve definite plans for increased production of tobacco leaf<br>
of suitable quality, and that appropriate consultation take place with the<br>
Australian Tobacco Board.<br>
ToBAcco MARKTING.--Council considered the position in States directly concerned<br>
regarding uniform State legislation on the marketing of tobacco. All<br>
tobacco-producing States were not in favour of the introduction of the necessary<br>
legislation, and Council was of the opinion that, after the present season,<br>
any stabilized marketing of tobacco leaf must be entirely dependent on action<br>
taken by the respective States. Council recommended that representatives of<br>
the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, the Australian Tobacco Board,<br>
the Prices Commissioner and the four State Departments of Agriculture concerned<br>
should meet to devise plans to achieve some form of stability for sub-<br>
Lmission to Ministers and consideration at the next meeting of Council.<br>
POTATO MARIKETING.-Council noted that the functions of the Australian<br>
JPotato Committee had been continued to cover the 1947-48 crop, but the comnmittee<br>
could not continue to function. If organized marketing were to continue,<br>
a State action would be essential in the near future and for effective action coordination<br>
of the activities of the State organizations was necessary. Growers'<br>
organizations had approached the Commonwealth requesting continuance of<br>
Commonwealth guaranteed prices for potatoes. The Commonwealth would be<br>
prepared to consider such a request, but would need to be assured that marketing<br>
was organized on a basis that would ensure supplies being spread over the<br>
season; give a fair allocation of available supplies throughout the Commonwealth;<br>
and prevent over-supply to markets and depressed prices.<br>
EGc INiDUsTRY.-Council noted that from the surplus funds of the Commonwealth<br>
Egg Control, which would probably amount finally to between œ 700,000<br>
and œ 750,000, the Commonwealth Government had already agreed to the distribution<br>
of œ 300,000 between State Egg Boards on the basis of recorded<br>
production in each State during the period of Commonwealth control up to<br>
June, 1947. Council was informed the Commonwealth Government considered<br>
that it should be reimbursed from surplus funds for losses directly incurred<br>
in connexion with egg-drying plans since their introduction in the war period.<br>
Council decided that this be agreed to up to a maximum of œ 100,000. As regards<br>
the balance of the money, Council recommended that It be distributed to State<br>
' ga Boards pro rata to contributions to the control fund.<br>
POULTRY Co xEcEN.--Council decided to accept an invitation from the<br>
Danish Government to be represented at the Eighth World Congress of Poultry<br>
Breeders at Copeuhagen in August, 1948. The Principal of the Animal Health<br>
and Nutrition Laboratory of the West Australian Department of Agriculture<br>
( Dr. H. W. Bennetts), and the veterinary officer of the New South Wales<br>
Department of Agriculture ( Mr. G. L. McClymont) would be in Britain at that<br>
time, and an approach would be made to the Commonwealth Government to<br>
include those officers in the Australian delegation. The Commonwealth Dairy<br>
Officer at London ( Mr. A. D. Allanson) would attend the Congress.<br>
SuprpnEiPosSATE.-Council noted that National Security ( Superphosphate<br>
Industry) Regulations, which incorporated the Superphosphate Industry Committee,<br>
were discontinued from 1st anuary, 1948, and that the Minister for<br>
Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) had approved of the committee continuing to function<br>
a an advisory body. EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-RICE.<br>
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
Cabinet decided to-day that the Australian rice crop of 32,000<br>
tons should be allocated to essential needs in Australia ( hospitals,<br>
invalids, Asiatics and the like); to New Guinea, Papua and Pacific<br>
Islands; to Malaya and other rice-deficient countries; with a shipment<br>
to Britain."" </p>
<p>WHEAT STABILIZATION SCHEME.<br>
POST1WAR-CONTINUANCE, MINISTERS' CONFEREN( XkE.<br>
On 11th February, 1948, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)<br>
said that Commonwealth and State Ministers for Agriculture had<br>
considered stabilization of the wheat industry. The amended plan of<br>
the Commonwealth Government was the basis of the discussion. Conference<br>
also received a submission from the Australian Wheatgrowers'<br>
Federation setting out its views. He had indicated to State Ministe,<br>
that he would submit to Cabinet a suggestion that the period of the<br>
plan be extended for one year to take in the 1952-53 harvest, thus<br>
making the initial period of operation of the plan eight years from the<br>
1945-46 harvest. He had indicated that if the findings of the Wheat<br>
Industry Costs Committee proved that it was impracticable to have an<br>
index formula for adjusting costs movements, or if application of itb<br>
findings proved impracticable, the Government would make periodi?!<br>
review of costs movements. The Government would determine the period<br>
of review and the machinery of review at the appropriate time. He<br>
had undertaken to recommend to Cabinet that a properly constituted<br>
authority be set up to provide for and determine any refund to wheatgrowers<br>
who had an equity in the Wheat Stabilization Fund if for an. N<br>
reason they were arbitarily forced to cease wheat growing.<br>
On some other points State Ministers were not prepared to commit<br>
their Government, but considered it necessary to have further consultation<br>
with them. That applied particularly to the federation's request<br>
that a ballot on wheat stabilization legislation should be tak,-en of all<br>
whcatgrowers of the Commonwealth who were registered and had sown<br>
acres or more to wheat.<br>
It was agreed that the matter would be discussed if desired after<br>
State Governments had considered the matter further and determined<br>
their policy on fundamental features of the plan.<br>
(] For earlier references, please see No. 106, page 62; No. 129, page<br>
No. 133, page 23.)<br>
POST-WAR-CONTINIANCE, EXTENSION.<br>
On 2nd March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
Cabinet to-day decided that the wheat stabilization plan be extended<br>
by one season to cover five seasons after 1947-48.<br>
Cabinet also approved the principle of setting aside up to half<br>
the annual interest earned by the wheat stabilization fund to repay<br>
approved eases in which a refund of tax payments is merited. The<br>
latter decision covers ' hard luck cases. Further consideration will be<br>
given to the constitution of an outhority to deal with these cases."".<br>
BRITAIN.<br>
FINANCIAL POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT,<br>
FEBRUARY, 19,48.<br>
On 11th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" The fall in values of shares on Australian stock exchanges may<br>
be attributed to various factors. These include the fall in overseas </p>
<p>prices for grain; President Truman's various statements that something<br>
must be done to retard rising prices and costs; and Britain's difficult<br>
economic position because the drain on . gold reserves has not been<br>
reduced as hoped. Speeches and statements by the British Chancellor<br>
of the Exchequer ( Sir Stafford Cripps), backed by facts, have made<br>
it clear that the going will be difficult. As a consequence, profits are<br>
not being reaped as they were before.<br>
"" What happens on Australian stock exchanges is a reflection of what<br>
has happened in Britain and the United States, where there is every<br>
indication that a recession is coming.<br>
There is nothing more in it as far as Australia is concerned except<br>
in regard to prices for primary products, although these are mainly<br>
safeguarded by firm contracts. The second factor in Australia is<br>
concern as to rising costs. Opportunities offering to Australia for<br>
expansion and development are the greatest in history, and I am confident<br>
that that will take place even allowing for an overseas recession."".<br>
TAXATION.<br>
COMPANY TAX-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br>
On 12th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said:<br>
During the war, and since its conclusion, a good deal of adverse<br>
criticism has been directed against the incidence of income taxation<br>
on companies. Numerous published reports of annual meetings of<br>
companies have contained references to the crushing burden of taxation,<br>
its stifling effect on enterprise and the generally adverse economic<br>
effects of the Government's taxation policy.<br>
"" Such comments have appeared so frequently that I am sure that,<br>
by force of sheer repetition, they are accepted as representing the facts<br>
of the position. So far as I am aware, no one has bothered to analyse<br>
the burden of taxation on companies and to relate that burden to company<br>
income levels. Obviously, taxation has increased as a result of the<br>
war; but the incomes out of which that taxation has been paid have not<br>
remained static, but have increased. The important factor is the relationship<br>
between the incomes remaining to companies after payment<br>
of taxation in the periods prior to, during, and subsequent to the war.<br>
Australia's participation in the recent war necessitated that every<br>
section of the community should bear a share of the tremendous cost<br>
associated with the war. It was determined at an early date that as far<br>
as possible Australia should, as a policy, attempt to meet war costs from<br>
current income and so reduce borrowing to a minimum. Accordingly,<br>
the rates and scope of all existing taxes were increased and new taxes<br>
imposed so as to ensure as far as possible that equality of sacrifice<br>
was achieved between the various components of the community. Row<br>
successful this policy proved has now become part and parcel of the<br>
financial history of the Commonwealth.<br>
It was realized that the primary and most flexible source of war<br>
revenue was income tax, since by a graduated income tax there is<br>
achieved the maximum degree of equity between individual taxpayers </p>
<p>and equality of sacrifice. The rates of individual income tax wore<br>
increased in 1940, 1941, and again in 1943, when they reached their<br>
peak. Companies, in their turn, were called upon to make some contribution<br>
to the cost of the war.<br>
"" Immediately before the outbreak of war companies were liable,<br>
for Commonwealth purposes, to normal tax, imposed at a fiat rate of<br>
is. 1. Sd. in the œ 1 on each œ 1 of their taxable income. A private<br>
company, which mnay be broadly defined as a company which is under<br>
the control of not more than seven persons and whiceh is not a company<br>
in which the public is substantially interested, was liable for the additional<br>
tax which would have been payable by its shareholders if the<br>
undistributed amount had been distributed. In addition, companies<br>
were liable to various income taxes imposed by the States.<br>
"" According to the Commonwealth Year Book ( Vol. 36, p. 745)<br>
collections from companies in the financial year 1938-1939 were as<br>
follows Commonwealth collections 4,300,0001<br>
State collections 11,498,000 15,798,000<br>
"" Reference to the ' Twenty-second Report of the Commissioner of<br>
Taxation shows that, for Commonwealth purposes, companies derived<br>
a taxable income of œ 81,456,000 during the in-come year 1937-1938,<br>
the year to which collections for the financial year 1938-1939 are<br>
related. The variations between the States and the Commonwealth in the<br>
manner of ascertaining taxable income would raise the total taxable<br>
income to about œ 89,000,000 for all companies. Collections of<br>
œ 15,800,000 on this taxable income represent an overall effective rate<br>
of tax of 43.61d. or approximately 3s. Sd. in the For the year in<br>
question, therefore, companies, after payment of tax, had a total<br>
amount of profit available either for distribution or to place to reserves<br>
of œ 73,200,000. For the financial years 1939-1940 and 1940-1941 the rates of<br>
normal tax were increased to 2s. in the and in 1941-1942 the rate<br>
was increased to 4s. in the In 1942-1943, -with the introduction<br>
of uniform taxation, -companies were no longer subject to State income<br>
tax. To compensate for suspension of State tax, the rate of normal<br>
Commonwealth tax was increased from 4s. in the œ 1 to 6s. in the as<br>
the average rate of tax imposed on companies by the States was about<br>
2s. in the This point is frequently overlooked by critics who claim<br>
that the Commonwealth rate of normal company tax has increased by<br>
4s. 10.4d. ( that is, from Is. 1.8d. to whereas in reality, the rate has<br>
increased by only 2s. 10.4d.<br>
"" Companies were, of course, subjected to other imposts in addition<br>
to an in-crease in the rate of normal company tax. </p>
<p>"" Private companies continued throug hout the war and to the<br>
present time to be subject to the additional tax paid under' Division<br>
7 of the Income Tax A-ssessment Act. The amount of this tax is<br>
determined by reference to the amount of additional tax which would<br>
have been payable by the shareholders of the company if the company<br>
had paid the undistributed portion as a dividend. These assessments,<br>
as a consequence, reflected the rates of tax payable by individuals,<br>
which, as mentioned above, reached their peak in the financial year<br>
1943-1944.<br>
Much has been made of the incidence of this tax, it being claimed<br>
that it involves very high rates of tax. This view has arisen primarily<br>
because the Division 7 tax has been related to the undistributed amount<br>
and not to the taxable income, which is the true haze.<br>
The Twenty-sixth Annual Report of the Commissioner of Taxation<br>
( page 12) shows that for the financial year 1943-1944 private<br>
companies were assessed to œ 8,650,000 Division 7 tax on an undistributed<br>
income of œ 12,560,000. The average rate of Division 7 tax<br>
was therefore 165.3d. for each œ 1 of the undistributed amount. However,<br>
the taxable income of private companies in that year was.<br>
œ 51,486,000, so that the total Division 7 tax of œ 9,730,000 ( comprising<br>
œ 8,650,000 actually assessed and œ 1,080,000 estimated to be assessed)<br>
represents an average rate on the taxable income of 45.5d. in the œ 1.<br>
Although it may be considered that even the average rate -of<br>
45.5d. for Division 7 tax is high, it must be remembered that where<br>
a dividend is paid by a private company out of profits which have borne<br>
tax under Division 7 that dividend is virtually tax free in the hands of<br>
the shareholders, as they are entitled to a rebate of the tax -attributable<br>
to the inclusion of the dividend in the taxable income. No precise<br>
figures are available as to the amount of such tax free dividends, but<br>
some indication of their volume may be derived from the fact that in<br>
the income year 1943-1944 resident private companies paid dividends<br>
amounting to just over œ 19,000,000, the major portion of -which may<br>
be assumed to have been paid from funds which had borne Division<br>
7 tax. Non-private companies were also required to contribute their<br>
share to the rising costs of the war. As from the financial year<br>
1940-1941, non-private companies became liable for a super tax of<br>
is. in the œ 1 on that part of their taxable income in excess of œ 5,000.<br>
A super-tax rebate is allowed to avoid the dual payment of super-tax<br>
on income derived by a company and on dividends paid by that<br>
company to another company out of income on which super tax has.<br>
been paid or is payable.<br>
"" From the financial year 1940-1941, non-private companies have<br>
also been liable to a further tax of 2s. in the œ 1 on that portion of their<br>
taxable income which has not been distributed as dividends. The yield<br>
from this further tax has never exceeded œ-2,000,000 annually.<br>
War-time ( Company) Tax was also imposed on non-private companies<br>
for the financial year 1940-1941 et seq. This tax differed from. </p>
<p>the war-time profits tax imposed during World War I. and the British<br>
Excess Profits Tax. These latter taxes adopted a standard of pre-war<br>
profits and sought to drain off any profits in excess of this standard as<br>
being attributable to excess war profits. The War-time ( Company)<br>
Tax, however, was designed to levy tax on the basis of the percentage<br>
of the taxable profit to the capital employed.<br>
The number of companies which have been assessed to Wartime<br>
( Company) Tax has never been large-in fact, only 757 companies<br>
were so assessed for the financial year 1944-1945. These 757<br>
companies were assessed to œ 4,390,000 on a taxable profit of<br>
œ 28,500,000. The total taxable income of the companies concerned<br>
amounted to œ 45,400,000, the War-time ( Company) Tax therefore<br>
being imposed at an effective average rate of only some 23s. 2d. If the<br>
total taxable income of all public companies, œ 98,621.000, is taken<br>
into account in weighing the effect of War-time ( Company) Tax,<br>
the effective average rate is only 10.7d. in the œ 1.<br>
"" In considering the incidence of War-time ( Company) Tax, it<br>
should be remembered that, in determining the amount of War-time<br>
( Company) Tax payable, the amount of super tax payable by the<br>
company is allowed as a rebate from the War-time ( Company) Tax<br>
otherwise payable. The allowance of the rebate has the practical<br>
effect of rendering many companies non-taxable for the purposes of<br>
War-time (' Company) Tax.<br>
Having briefly surveyed the existing taxes on companies and<br>
commented on their individual incidence, it may be of interest to set<br>
out, as accurately as available statistics permit, the total weight of<br>
taxation on both private and non-private companies. The main source<br>
of these statistics are the Annual Reports of the Commissioner of<br>
Taxation. "" In the financial year 1944-1945 private companies were<br>
assessed to the following taxes on a total taxable income of œ 55,500,000,<br>
which was derived during the year ended June 30, 1944-<br>
Normal tax at Gs. in the œ 1 15.690.000<br>
Division 7 tax actually assessed to 30th June, 1946 2,289,000<br>
Estimated to be assessed after 30th June, 1946 1,342,000 3,631,000<br>
19,321,000<br>
Thus, for the financial year 1944-1945, private companies paid<br>
on their total taxable income, an average rate of 83.5d. in the œ 1.<br>
"" It must, however, be observed that the Division 7 tax payable<br>
in respect of the financial year 1944-1945 was reduced by 75 per cent.<br>
as a result of the introduction of the system of pay-as-you-earn.<br>
Consequently, the ' average rate of tax arrived at above is not representative<br>
of all years.<br>
"" The Division 7 tax payable in respect of the financial year<br>
1943-44 ( in which year the peak war-time rates were first operative) </p>
<p>amuounted to œ 9,743,000 on a taxable income of œ 51,486,000 representing<br>
the levy of Division 7 tax at an average rate of 45.5d. in'the E1.<br>
If this rate is accepted as typical of the Division 7 tax payable when<br>
rates were at their peak, the overall rate of 194445 would have been<br>
113.3d., if the 75 per cent. rebate had not been granted.<br>
Preliminary figures for the financial year 1945-1946 tend to<br>
confirm this overall average rate, the tentative 1945-19-48 figure being<br>
115.8d. It can be said then that the overall average rate of tax paid by<br>
private companies when rates -of tax were at their highest approximated<br>
9.6d. in the œ 1.<br>
"" For the financial year 1944-1945 ( income year 1943-1944), the<br>
taxable income of public companies amounted to œ 98,621,000. These<br>
companies were assessed to the following taxes:<br>
Normal tax at Gs. in the œ 1 26,780,000<br>

War-time ( Conipany) Tax -4,390,000 37,072,000<br>
"" The overall average rate of tax paid by public companies for the<br>
financial year 1944-1945 was therefore 90.2d.<br>
"" Although public companies appear to have an advantage over<br>
private companies in that the overall average rate of tax paid by them<br>
is less than that paid by private companies, any dividends paid by<br>
public companies are, in the generality of cases, fully taxable in the<br>
bands of the individual recipient. On the other hand, dividends paid<br>
by private companies out of funds which have borne tax under Division<br>
7 may be regarded for all practical purposes, as exempt in the hands<br>
of the shareholder.<br>
11I think that it is, therefore, fair to say that the effective rate<br>
of tax imposed on all companies over the war years would approximate<br>
in the Li-or 7s. 6d. in the In the light of the sacrifices<br>
and demands made upon other sections of the community, I do not<br>
think that companies have been unfairly treated by the incidence of<br>
income taxation, -In fact, when compared with the weight of company<br>
taxation in other countries, companies in Australia have escaped lightly<br>
over the war years.<br>
But what has been the general effect on companies of the in-creased<br>
rates of taxation? In 1938-1939, the combined collections from company<br>
income tax by the Commonwealth and the States were nearly<br>
œ 16,000,000; 1944-1945, Commonwealth collections from companies<br>
amounted to œ 60,000,000. The initial reaction is that during the war<br>
years, the profits avail-able to companies after payment Of tax must<br>
have diminished considerably in order to meet the additional taxes<br>
of some œ 44,000,000. But such has not been the case. Since 1938-1939, </p>
<p>the national income has increased by some 64 per cent., and companies<br>
have enjoyed a similar increase in their taxabte incomes. The net<br>
result h-as been that, despite the burden of war taxation, companies<br>
have had more available, either for distribution to shareholders or to<br>
place to reserve, than they had in pre-war years. This I regard as at<br>
tribute to the manner in which my Government has financed the war<br>
and created conditions of relative economic prosperity.<br>
The extent to which net company profits have increased over the<br>
war years is apparent from the following table which is based uponL<br>

have never fallen below the 1938-1939 level, and had, in fact, by<br>

profits accruing to residents have at least been maintained over the<br>

of company tax has ruined companies and retarded economic progress,<br>
will uow be scotched for all time. Companies% have, along with other<br>
sections of the community, received the benefit of the Government's<br>
policy of full employment, resulting in an expansion of all forms of<br>
economic activity.<br>
"" That my Government is alive to the-important influence which<br>
companies have on the economic life of the community is evidenced by<br>
the fact that since the end of the war, the taxation of both private<br>
Creceiavnde ndon -private companies has been reduced. Private companies have<br>
the benefit of the greatly reduced rates of tax payable by<br>
individuals in their Division 7 assessments. Non-private companies9<br>
are no longer subject to War-time ( Company) Tax, a fact which should<br>
prove of great benefit to newly established and expanding businesses.""~<br>
On 23rd February, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
There has been some criticism of my recent statement on company<br>
taxation. Most of the comment is extraneous to the main issue, being<br>
directed at the weight of all taxation, the level of Government expenditure<br>
and the extent of Governmental control. A statement on the<br>
incidence of company taxation is not the appropriate place to deal with<br>
such comment which will be replied to at the appropriate time and<br>
place. "" Other critics appear to have overlooked the fact that the statement<br>
dealt only with the incidence of income tax on companies. at<br>
has been argued, for instance, that because a rebate of company tax<br>
isq not now allowed to shareholders on dividends;, companies are paying<br>
more tax than pre-war. These critics appear to have found it necessary<br>
to bolster their case by taking into account the tax paid by individuals-<br>
a factor which is not relevant to the issue.<br>
Another critic has pointed out that net company income ( that<br>
is, after payment of taxes) as a percentage of national income has<br>
declined from 9.1 per cent. in 1938-39 to 6.8 per cent, in 1946-47.<br>
This comparison of percentages merely tends to obscure the real issue.<br>
The fact that must constantly he borne in mind is that the actual level<br>
of net company income, after payment of tax, has increased from<br>
œ 73,000,000 in 1938-39 to œ 87,000,000 in 1946-47-an increase of<br>
œ 14,000,000 or nearly 20 per cent.<br>
Some of the criticism, however, calls for some reply. For instance,<br>
it has been stated that companies are now unable to, pursue a policy<br>
of development and expansion because undistributed profitb available<br>
to companies in 1946-47 were only œ 5,000,000 higher at œ 39,000,000<br>
than they were in 1938-39. It is claimed that this increase is inadequate<br>
to meet present day costs of acquiring equipment and plant. </p>
<p>"" In my opinion, the criticism overlooks certain important factors.<br>
In the first place, undistributed profits are not the only source of<br>
funds for development and expansion of companies. Secondly, the<br>
undistributed profits available to companies during the war years never<br>
fell below the 1938-39 level and actually rose as high as œ 42,000,000.<br>
The Government has shown companies sympathetic consideration in<br>
allowing them to retain these undistributed profits during the war.<br>
It is certain that individual taxpayers did not have the same opportunity<br>
of building up similar reserves during the period when individual<br>
rates of tax were at their peak.<br>
The total of undistributed profits accruing to companies during<br>
and immediately after the war, amounted to some œ 180,000,000.<br>
Shortages of man-power and materials have, up to the present, largely<br>
precluded expenditure of these reserves on replacement or development<br>
work. A reasonably large proportion of this accumulation should<br>
now be available for this purpose.<br>
Obsolete and outworn plant, and the like, are normally replaced<br>
by means of a depreciation reserve which is built up over the life of<br>
the plaiw. Thus a considerable proportion of the capital necessary<br>
to replace existing plant and equipment should already be in the hand<br>
of companies. In addition, they rould have recourse to their accumulated<br>
undistributed profits.<br>
"" Further, the purchase of new, and replacement of obsolete plant<br>
and equipment is encouraged by special depreciation provisions in the<br>
Income Tax A. ssessment Act. These provide an initial depreciation<br>
allowance of 20 per cent. ( in addition to normal depreciation) on<br>
all depreciable assets acquired during the five years ended 30th June,<br>
1950. The combined effect of all these factors is largely if not completely<br>
to offset the higher cost of new machinery and equipment.<br>
It has also been suggested that the average rates of tax payable<br>
by companies, as calculated in my original statement, over the war<br>
yei: rs are misleading, because some companies paid more and some less<br>
tlian the average rate. This is inherent in all averages, but the average<br>
rate of 7s. 6d. in the œ 1 paid by companies does indicate that the great<br>
proportion of companies paid either this rate or less on the whole of<br>
their taxable income.<br>
None of the critics has been able to refute the facts contained in<br>
my statement or to deny that as compared with other sections of the<br>
community ( and with other countries), companies have received fair<br>
treatment from the taxation viewpoint.""<br>
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH.<br>
PROPOSED CONFERENCE.<br>
On 13th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
Nothing can be gained by holding a British Commonwealth Conference<br>
at the moment. I cannot say what the future holds, as something<br>
is taking place all the time. We understand the position on<br>
finance and on the question of a production drive. First of all. production<br>
is aimed at providing food for Britain. The more we enrouraqe </p>
<p>increased production the closer we are to the solution of all difficulties.<br>
The fundamental thing is to get the best possible production to solve<br>
the dollar crisis, our own shortages and the need for food. But at the<br>
moment, on the informaticn available to us, there is nothing to be<br>
gained by a special conference. What the future holds will be determined<br>
in the light of circumstances."".<br>

that the financial and accounting procedures are well-designed<br>

TUBERCULOSIS-CABINET DECISION.<br>
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" Cabinet to-day considered recommendations for a plan to wage<br>
war on tuberculosis, designed to reduce tuberculosis to a problem of<br>
min-or importance within twenty years. Apart from its toll in human<br>
misery and distress, tuberculosis involves vast economic loss to the<br>
nation through loss of mnan-power hours in industry, lowering of the </p>
<p>birth rate and the expenditure of millions of pounds on treatment, convalescence<br>
and social benefits. The disease demands national concern<br>
both because its incidence fails very heavily on young adults in their<br>
most productive and reproductive years but also because, being<br>
infectious, it is a source of real danger to every person in the community.<br>
If detected early it can usually be arrested and the patient<br>
returned to useful citizenship.<br>
he Federal Health Council, the National Health and Medical<br>
Research Council and medical bodies have been advocating for many<br>
years a vigorous attack on tuberculosis under Commonwealth leadership<br>
and with adequate Commonwealth financial backing. The power conferred<br>
on the Commonwealth Parliament at the last referendum to provide<br>
medical services has opened the way to Commonwealth entry into<br>
the field as well as imposing a high responsibility on the Commonwealth.<br>
Principles and methods to be applied to the control of tuberculosis are<br>
well established and have been effectively applied in other parts of the<br>
world-notably in Scandanavian countries, Canada ( particularly<br>
Ontario and Saskatchewan) and in most of the United States.<br>
The recently appointed Commonwealth Director of Tuberculosis<br>
H. W. Wunderly) has completed a survey of the facilities and<br>
needs in each State in relation to this disease which, it is estimated,<br>
atiects from 30,000 to 40,000 persons.<br>
Cabinet authorized the Minister for Health ( Senator McKenna)<br>
to draft legislation to effect necessary amendments to the Tuberculosis<br>
Act. Senator McKenna stressed that no housing problem was of greater<br>
urgency than that of housing in isolation in suitably equipped buildings<br>
sufferers who: as well as needing to be saved from the disease, are a<br>
nenace to the health and lives of their fellows unless precautionary<br>
measures are strictly observed.<br>
The co-operation of the . States will be sought in making a uniform<br>
approach to the problem. Subject to agreement between the States and<br>
the Commonwealth as to a general plan of campaign evolved in consultation,<br>
the Commonwealth will provide the necessary money for new<br>
buildings and equipment and will be prepared to provide a substantial<br>
proportion of maintenance involved.<br>
Dr. Wunderly's report will be circulated to the States as a basis<br>
for discussion and Dr. Wunderly will argair visit all States in the near<br>
future. A very brief summary of Dr. Wunderly's report shows that an<br>
important element in an attack on tuberculosis is the education of the<br>
, public to prevent the spread of the disease. In this, the Government<br>
invites the co-operation of the press, the radio, the newsreels and<br>
voluntary bodies who, with limited finances and facilities, have done<br>
splendid work in combating the disease and making the public conscious<br>
of tuhbrculosis. I am confident that this co-operation will be forthcoming.<br>
The full co-operation of medical schools, teaching hospitals<br>
and o. ther institutions is also desired. It is estimated that the Commonwalrh<br>
will, from an early sage of the campaign, be involved in consi!<br>
crable expendcture. Thli will in in addition to the amounts now being </p>
<p>expended annually by State governments. The Government is anxious<br>
that there should be an immediate, vigorous and efficient approach to<br>
the treatment, prevention and control of tuberculosis in this country"".<br>

Persons from certain groups at present to be brought into the schemedisabled<br>
ex-members of the forces covered by Part IV. of the Re-establishment and<br>
Employment Act as at time of the commencement of the general scheme for the<br>
rehabilitation of disabled persons; invalid pensioners or claimants for the invalid<br>
pension; those receivinl or claiming unemployment or sickness benefits who may<br>
become unemployed unl ss rehabilitation assistance is given.<br>
A report to be presented within twelve months on the practicability and<br>
desirability of including adolescents.<br>
Adoption of the plrinciple of inclusion ultimately of recognized industrial<br>
diseases groups within the scheme.<br>
Eligibility to be restricted to cases drawn from the groups set out above<br>
where the disability has already lasted thirteen weeks at the time of application,<br>
appears likely to last at least a further thirteen weeks ( making 26 weeks<br>
in all) and to he a substantial handicap to the person in securing suitable<br>
employment; yet is remediable and allows of reasonable prospects of employ.<br>
ability within two years.<br>
During medical treatment, the pensioner should continue to receive his social<br>
services benefit and also the actual cost of fares where he is required to travel<br>
for treatment. The fares paid are not to be regarded as ' income' under the<br>
Social Services Consolidation Act.<br>
During vocational training, the trainee should receive a benefit at the rate<br>
of, and subject to, a means test similar to that for invalid pensions, plus a<br>
training allowance of 20s. a week, the actual cost of fares where he is required<br>
to travel regularly for training, and a living away from home allowance as<br>
outlined above.<br>
Medical examination to determine eligibility to be free. Cost of medical<br>
treatment to be borne by the Commonwealth only to the extent to which the<br>

to the patient on a basis to be fixed by the Department of Social Services and<br>
the Treasury.<br>
A bill to be prepared for submission to the Federal Parliamentary Labour<br>
party. Pending the passing of legislation, the Government authorize the commencement<br>
of the scheme as outlined to operate from 1st January, 1948, to permit of<br>
continuity of the treatment and training of ex-service personnel accepted under<br>
Part IV. of the Re-establishment and Employment Act as at 31st December,<br>

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT-QUEENSLAND.<br>
On 25th February, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
In connexion with the payment of unemployment benefit to persons<br>
involved in or affected by the present Queensland industrial dispute,<br>
the Social Services Consolidation Act provides that benefit is not<br>
payable to an applicant whose unemployment is due to him being a<br>
direct participant in a strike.<br>
In relation to other persons involved in or affected by an industrial<br>
dispute, the Minister for Social Services has issued instructions which<br>
are being observed by the Department of Social Services in Queensland<br>
at present and throughout the Commonwealth. These instructions are<br>
the outcome of a full consideration of the relevant parts of the Act of a<br>
Cabinet sub-committee early in 1947. In brief, the instructions embody<br>
the following principles:--<br>
In respect of unions on strike and unions sponsoring a strike of its members in<br>
key positions, member'. of these unions, whether directly participating in the<br>
strike, or unemployed as a direct or indirect consequence of the strike, are not to<br>
be regarded as eligible to receive unemployment benefit.<br>
In respect of union not on strike. or apparently having no members on strike,<br>
members of these unions are to he regarded as eligible to receive unemployment<br>
benefit. A ersoin i-nit to be disquiialificd for iiieminployinmet benefit by reason only<br>
of his refusal to undertake work available through a strike or lockout.<br>
Persons eligible under these principles for benefit will, of course,<br>
have to satisfy the other eligibility provisions in the Act<br>
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS.<br>
OVERSEAS REPRESENTATION.<br>
On 16th February, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br>
Evatt) said-<br>
The Government is taking steps to raise the status of the Australian<br>
missions in Russia, France and China. The fact that these three countries<br>
have seen fit to accord the increased status to Australia is tangible<br>
recognition of the increased role which Australia has come to play<br>
in international affairs in recent years.<br>
The status of the Australian mission in the United States was<br>
raised from that of Minister to Ambassador in June, 1946, and this last<br>
action, covering the remaining permanent members of the Security<br>
Council, is in accordance with a decision taken in principle by the<br>
Government at that time.<br>
"" The change, while not increasing either the size of staffs or<br>
financial commitments, is largely to indicate the importance which each<br>
country attaches to the other with which it has diplomatic relations,<br>
and it is related to the seniority of the particular representative and<br>
the facilities to be made available to him in the country to wnich he is<br>
accredited ii </p>

JAPAN.<br>
TRADE-PRIVATE TRADING.<br>
On 22nd February, 1948, the Prime Minister) said-<br>
Arrangements have now been completed with the Supreme Command<br>
of the Allied Powers in Japan to permit the early resumption<br>
of two-way trade on a limited scale between Australia and Japan<br>
within the general framework of the Interim Sterling Payments Agreement<br>
recently negotiated with Supreme Command Allied Powers by the<br>
British authorities.<br>
"" The agreement provides for all private trade between Japan and<br>
the sterling area ( excluding Hong Kong) to be financed in sterling<br>
through special sterling accounts established in the name of Supreme<br>
Command Allied Powers with British banks. The agreement to which<br>
Australia is a party was concluded in November, 1947, but the necessary<br>
banking arrangements have only recently been completed.<br>
"" One of the clauses of the agreement provides that unused balances<br>
held in Supreme Command Allied Power's sterling accounts may be<br>
innverted into dollars at six monthly intervals. Because of this clause </p>
<p>29<br>
it has been necessary to treat Japan as virtually a ' dollar' country<br>
for import licensing purposes and up to the present no licences have<br>
been granted for the private importation of Japanese goods.<br>
"" Arrangements have now been made with Supreme Command<br>
Allied Powers which will, to some extent, overcome the difficulties<br>
created by the convertibility ejause and will permit two-way trade to<br>
be revived on a limited scale. The basis of the arrangement is that<br>
the Commonwealth Government will authorize the issue of licences<br>
for the importation by private traders of certain essential goods from<br>
Japan thus providing Supreme Command Allied Powers with funds for<br>
the purchase of Australian wool and other products.<br>
Stocks of wool in Japan are very low and exports of Australian<br>
wool to Japan since the cessation of hostilities have been limited to a<br>
single shipment of about 7,500 bales. Further purchases have not been<br>
possible because Japan has not been able to finance them. As payment<br>
is miade for Australian imports of Japanese goods under the arrangenient<br>
now concluded Supreme Command Allied Powers will be in a<br>
position to resume purchases of Australian wool through agents at the<br>
auctions. An undertaking, has been g-iveni ly Supreme Command Allied<br>
1Powers that the whole of the proceeds of permitted imports into Australia<br>
from Japan will be used for the purchase of Australian wool and<br>
other prodlucts and no question of conversion of marginal amounts into<br>
dollars will therefore arise.<br>
Cotton textiles and cotton yarn are excluded from the arrangement<br>
because they are at present available only against dollar payments but<br>
impiort lienfes will be granted for Japanese raw silk, rayon yarn,<br>
milling silk and certain essential utility types of rayon textiles.""<br>
( ror earlier references, please see No. 128, page 24; No. 132, page 3.)<br>
On 24th February, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator<br>
(' nurtice) said that since the cessation of hostilities, cotton textiles,<br>
rayon yarn and raw silk had been purchased by the Commonwealth<br>
Government from Japan, but it was not expected that further Government<br>
cash purchases would be undertaken. Licences will be issued for<br>
raw silk and rayon yarn direct to users, while licences for milling silk<br>
would be issued to importers who had been obtaining their requirements<br>
from other sources. Licences would be granted for suitable types of<br>
porcelain insulators and. it was intended to restrict the issue of those<br>
licences to electric light and power undertakings. Regarding cotton<br>
piece goods, the occupation authorities still required dollars in payment<br>
and import licences would not be issued.<br>

BOARD OF REVIEW.<br>
On 23rd February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>

<p>REPARATIONS.<br>
' GERMANY-SCIENTIFIC PERSONNEL.<br>
On 24th February, 1948, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction<br>
( Mr. Dedman) announced that arrangements has been made for the<br>
admission of more German scientists to Australia to assist in research<br>
and production problems associated with industrial development.<br>
Before allotment to specific tasks, the Government would make the<br>
experts available to industrialists for general consultation. They<br>
included-Dr. R. Hoffnan. who specialized in the treatment of metal surfaces<br>
especially for the electrical industry ( including the preparation of surfaces<br>
anti-ccrrosive alluys, anodising electro-plating and sherardising) and the<br>
technical application of electro-osmosis.<br>
Dr. F. O. Weinert, who would advise on processes concerning the extracting<br>
of salts from German potash deposits, new compounds for seed treatment, dyestuffs<br>
and intermediates, tlerinclhemistry of iron from ores, magnesium and<br>
production of intermediates.<br>
Dr. J. Unterzaucher, a micro-analyst.<br>
Dr. H. Ritter and a technical assistant, who were experts in the designing<br>
and manufacturing of scientific instruments relating to nmasurement technique,<br>
including those for geodetic, astronomic, optic and inter-ferometric purposes.<br>
On 13th March, 1948, Mr. Dedman announced that arrangements<br>
had been made for the admission of more German scientists to Australia<br>
during March, 1948. They were-<br>
Dr. A. Gross, chemist, qualified in research and manufacture of artificial<br>
resins; Dr. T. Feuerriegel, expert on optical and similar instruments; Messrs.<br>
H. Hock, specialist in design and production of machine tools; T. Schobel,<br>

RECONSTRUCTION.<br>
WORLD ORGANIZATION-TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT<br>
AGREEMENT.<br>
In Parliamen.-On 26th February, 1948, the Minister for Postwar<br>
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) said-<br>
I lay on the table the following paper:-<br>
United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment-Memorandum<br>
showing alteration of Tariff duties,<br>
in substitution for the paper tabled on 18th November, 1947, by the<br>
Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. This document, while including<br>
all the information contained in the previous document, gives additional<br>
information and should be of greater assistance to the House<br>
when studying the tariff alterations resulting from the International<br>
Conference on Trade and Employment.""<br>
( For earlier references, please see No. 132, page 3.)<br>
In Parliament.-On 26th February, 1948, the Prime Minister<br>
( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The great struggle which democracy is having to-day to combat<br>
the inroads of communism is due to the fact that the conservative<br>
interests of the world have fertilized the soil in which communism has </p>
<p>grown over the centuries. The Labour party is just as concerned about<br>
production as is any other party. It is actuated not so much by<br>
political motives as by a desire to satisfy the need of the great mass<br>
of the people of Australia for essential goods and to make the utmost<br>
possible contribution to the welfare of other peoples of the world, many<br>
of whom are starving. That is not a political creed; it is a humanitarian<br>
creed.<br>
"" One has to cast one's mind back over events of recent years to<br>
realize the source from which the Geneva trade agreement and other<br>
matters have sprung. I recall the state of affairs in 1941-42, when the<br>
people of Britain were standing -almost alone. Some method had to be<br>
devised to secure help from the United States, and I think the idea<br>
developed in the mind of President Roosevelt ' himself. It had to be<br>
something which, to use the vernacular, he knew he would be able to<br>
sell to the American people. Out of this idea grew at various times the<br>
Atlantic Charter, the Mutual Aid Agreement, and the Lend-Lease<br>
Agreement. I. am able to realize the very difficult position in which<br>
Britain was situated and in which Mr. Churchill, the then British<br>
leader, found himself in fighting for the preservation of his country.<br>
Unless Britain and the Dominions had been able to obtain large quantities<br>
of arms and goods from the United States and to take advantage<br>
of the great industrial, financial, and man-power resources of that<br>
country, it is very doubtful whether we could have won the war.<br>
Civilization itself might have been destroyed. The Atlantic Charter,<br>
the Mutual Aid Agreement, the Lend-Lease Agreement and Article<br>
VII. of the trade charter, all arose in the first place from discussions<br>
between President Roosevelt, one of the great men of history, and Mr.<br>
-Churchill. "" I do not believe that Mr. -Churchill was ever anxious to have<br>
included in Article VII. any proposals for revision of tariffs.. He<br>
knew that the United States had always looked with strong disfavour<br>
on Imperial preferences, and he knew also that Canada had never been<br>
keen on -contractual Imperial preference obligations. I think I may<br>
thus interpret the utterances of the Prime Minister of Canada, who<br>
has been the leader of that country for a l-ong time, without committing<br>
a political libel. I do not say that he did not believe in some sort of<br>
preference, but it is evident that he has never been enthusiastic about<br>
being bound by contractual obligations.<br>
"" President Roosevelt had great political problems in his own<br>
country at that time. For a long time, the policy of a great majority<br>
of the people of the U nited States had been to, ' keep out of Europe<br>
not to engage in any conflict on that continent, either militarily or<br>
otherwise. Therefore, President Roosevelt had to offer to his people<br>
something in return for what was one of the most generous gestures<br>
in history-the provisions of the Lend-tease Agreement and the Mutual<br>
Aid Agreement. On the other side of the bargain, we had a great<br>
leader in Mr. Churchill, who realized the desperate straits of his<br>
country. Re knew that Britain had been selling its foreign securities<br>
to obtain credits, and that this reserve was becoming rapidly depleted. </p>
<p>32<br>
Indeed, Britain had to make its purchases abroad on a cash-and-carry<br>
basis. Mr. Churchill knew that if this situation continued there could.<br>
be only one end-that Britain could not carry on the war. It was very<br>
doubtful at that time whether 60 per cent. of the American people were<br>
in favour of participation in a European conflict. Confronted with<br>
these tremendous problems, Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt agreed to<br>
insert into the Lend-Lease Agreement the conditions contained in<br>
Article VII. which provided that consideration was to be given after the<br>
war to a general reduction of tariff barriers. No doubt Mr. Churchill.<br>
agreed to that provision reluctantly. At that time Australia was in a<br>
most desperate position, and it had no alternative but to join in the<br>
undertaking given to the United States by Britain. At that time<br>
Britain could not help us because physically it was incapable of doing<br>
so, and it was only because of the volume of aid supplied by the United<br>
States in the form of personnel, aircraft, equipment and services that<br>
Australia was not invaded.<br>
"" In the circumstances prevailing at the time the action taken by the<br>
Australian Government was completely justified. Of course, if the<br>
matter had been left to us, we should not have initiated a conference<br>
to discuss the reduction of world tariff barriers, but, as I said<br>
previously, we were bound by a contractual obligation. Moreover,<br>
other factors entered into the matter. Britain desperately needed a<br>
reduction of world trade barriers if its economy were to survive in the<br>
aftermath of war. The Australian Government realized fully the<br>
position of Britain, and because of that, and because of our. contractual<br>
obligation-or, should I say, moral obligation-we agreed to the provisions<br>
of Article VII. of the Lend-Lease Agreement. In any event, the<br>
point of view of some of the other Dominions were opposed to ours.<br>
Canada, for example, was most anxious that a conference to discuss<br>
Empire trade preference should be convened. At that time, responsiblepeople<br>
in Britain, irrespective of their political beliefs, did not believe<br>
that Britain could survive economically after the war unless it could<br>
export more goods into dollar areas; tariff barriers would have to be<br>
lowered to enable it to export to countries outside the Empire so as to<br>
compensate for the loss of its investments. It must be realized that<br>
during the war Britain lost a large number of its overseas investments,<br>
and was importing 50 per cent. of its imports from ' hard' currency,<br>
or dollar, areas. Furthermore, I think that members of the British<br>
Government believe that unless Britain received something similar<br>
to the American loan, which was later granted to it, it would not be<br>
possible to maintain even the lowered standard of living endured by<br>
its people during the war. At that time, it was idle to speculate on<br>
what Canada or South Africa might do after the war; the plain<br>
fact was that unless Britain was to receive a loan such as that made to,<br>
it later, its position would be unthinkable. The terms of the American<br>
loan were not ungenerous. Certainly, they contained provisions with<br>
regard to ' non-discrimination', but it must be remembered that the<br>
President, the Government of the United States and particularly the<br>
.1:<br>
' K1 </p>
<p>33<br>
Department of State, had to ' sell the Anglo-American loan to the<br>
American Congress. That loan had also to be approved by the United<br>
States Senate; approval which could not easily be obtained.<br>
"" Had that legislation not been passed, I dread to think of the<br>
position in which Britain would be placed to-day, more so when one<br>
remembers the tremendous task of rehabilitation wvhich confronts that<br>
country, and, indeed, the whole of Europe. I go further, and without<br>
wishing to arouse any panic or unnecessary anxiety, I say that if the<br>
legislation to implement the Marshall aid plans' is not enacted the<br>
economic position of Britain will be most difficult before the end of the<br>
present year.<br>
"" Australia participated in the International Conference on Trade<br>
and Employment for three main reasons. In the first place, we were<br>
morally obliged to do so because of Article VII. of the Lend-Lease Agreement,<br>
* and in any event, we wanted the benefit of the favorable provisions<br>
of that article. Secondly, the British Government was convinced<br>
that an agreement, such as was eventually reached at the<br>
conference, was absolutely essential to its economic existence, and<br>
finally we had our own privileges to preserve.<br>
I pay tribute to the members of the delegation which represented<br>
Australia at that conference. I am convinced that our representatives<br>
accomplished something really worth while, something at least comparable<br>
with the achievement of the British delegation. It was no easy<br>
task to assist the United States Government to convince its people<br>
that it was justified in doing things for other countries. Australia<br>
has suffered no, real loss as a result of the agreements or the tariff<br>
schedules that will be discussed later. It has played its part in world<br>
affairs and has contributed to the assistance of Britain.<br>
The fact of the matter is that American production to-d-ay is<br>
enormous; it amounts, I understand, to 55 per cent. of the total<br>
secondary production of the world. Because the United States sold<br>
three times as much as it bought, the dollars with which to purchase<br>
the goods it produces are not possessed by other countries. We may<br>
talk of our personal problems, hut it should be realized that the future<br>
welfare' of the masses of the people of this and other countries is to<br>
a large extent wrapped up in the solution of this world economic<br>
problem. Australia can play -only a small part; it can only show<br>
complete willingness to do all it can do to help. It is -all very well<br>
to scoff at theorists and idealists, but many ideas of great benefit to<br>
the world were conceived by people with ideal.<br>
The fact that there seems to be an almost insurmountable barrier<br>
to overcome is no reason why those who lead nations should not attempt<br>
to surmount it. I realize the present situation of Britain probably<br>
as well as any one in Australia, and I know the extent of the economic<br>
i[: ssistance that is needed from * thE. United States. I have an appreciation<br>
of the great difficulties confronting those who govern the rnited<br>
Sotates, which is a country in which there are many conflicting interests<br>
and many pressure groups. Human nature being what it is, there is </p>
<p>f<br>
i 34<br>
much difficulty in obtaining approval to measures such as the Anglo-<br>
American loan agreement and the Marshall plan. In this world one<br>
cannot take all and give nothing. We have not given very much<br>
materially, although we have contributed a great deal through the<br>
industry and ability of our representatives at international<br>
conferences."" NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.<br>
VICE-CHANCELLOR.<br>
On 2nd March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>

DIESEL ENGINES.<br>
On 2nd March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" The Commonwealth Government marine engine works at Port<br>
Melbourne ( Victoria) and Brisbane ( Queensland) were set up during<br>
the war under the Australian Shipbuilding Board for the construction<br>
of marine steam engines. Recently the Minister for Munitions<br>

the General Manager of the Government Ordnance Factories so that<br>
they might have access to a wider range of manufactures, including<br>
the construction of diesel engines.<br>
Cabinet to-day approved of the Department of Munitions, in<br>
consultation with the Australian . Shipbuilding Board, undertaking<br>
immediately the construction of six 3,000 horse-power marine diesel<br>
engines, of which two are required in 1949 and the remainder at<br>
intervals as may be required by the Board. A sum of œ 750,000 will<br>
be allocated for the purpose. The Munitions Department will open </p>
<p>negotiations for the purchase of manufacturing information and use<br>
of the patents of William Doxford and Sons Limited, of Sunderland,<br>
England. The Munitions Department, in conjunction with the Board, will<br>
arrange for the manufacture of standardized auxiliary machinery at a<br>
value of œ 250,000. Auxiliary machinery includes small power plants<br>
for lighting and ventilating, winches and hoists, steering gear, pumps<br>

INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT.<br>
On 7th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" For some weeks past, a special meeting of the International<br>
Wheat Council has been engaged at Washington in the negotiation of<br>
an International Wheat Agreement and advice has now been received<br>
from the Australian representative that agreement has jbeen reached<br>
among the partic ipating countries for submission to governments. The<br>
main proposals of the agreement are-<br>
"" The agreement will he for five years commencing from 1st August,<br>
1948. The range of prices will he from a maximum of two dollars a<br>
bushel to a minimum of one dollar ten cent in ' the fifth year of the<br>
agreement. The minimum in the first year will he one dollar fifty<br>
cents, the second year one dollar forty cents, the third year one dollar<br>
thirty cents, and the fourth year one dollar twenty cents. All prices are<br>
on the basis of in store Fort William, Canada.<br>
"" Sales will be made between the maximum of two dollars, which<br>
will operate for the whole of the agreement, and the minimumn applying<br>
to each particular year. The Australian equivalents will vary<br>
according to freight rates and whether sales from Australia are made<br>
to nearby or distant markets.<br>
"" Under present conditions it is estimated that the Australian<br>
equivalents are: maximum lie. 6d. to 12s. a bushel and minimum<br>
from 6s. to 6s. 6d. a bushel in the last year of the agreement.<br>
"" The total quantities covered in the agreement are 500,000,000<br>
bushels per annum, of which Australia's share will be 85,000,000<br>
bushels annually; the other participating exporters being Canada and<br>
the United States with shares of 230,000,00% and 185,000,000 bushels<br>
respectively. Importing countries represented at the conference<br>
numbered 33 and included Britain, India, France, Belgium, the<br>
Netherlands and China. </p>
<p>36<br>
Any wheat which exporters can make available above their share<br>
Sof the 500,000,000 bushels can be sold outside the agreement at any<br>
price which they can obtain on the market.<br>
"" The proposals will be placed before the Commonwealth Government<br>
for approval at a very early date, as my information is to the<br>
effect that several of the major importing countries, including Britain,<br>
have already intimated that their governments have agreed and will sign<br>
j the agreement immediately, while other delegates have recommended<br>
acceptance of the agreement to their governments.<br>
When it comes into operation the agreement will assure stability<br>
to wheat-growers for five years ahead.""<br>

CIVIL AVIATION.<br>
AELO-A'UTICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL.<br>
On 9th March, 194S, the Minister in charge of Scientific and Industrial<br>
Research ( Mr. Dedman) announced that an Aeronautical<br>
Research Conference, attended by representatives of the British Commonwealth,<br>
would be held in Australia in April, 1948. The conference<br>
would be the first formal meeting of the British Commonwealth<br>
Advisory Aeronautical Research Council which was set up by Britain<br>
and the various Dominion Governments following a meeting of aeronautical<br>
research workers at London in 1946. The council would<br>
co-ordinate research programmes throughout the British Commonwealth<br>
and plan collaborative programmes. It would act as a central<br>
liaison agency for the dissemination of scientific information on aeronautics,<br>
and the interchange and secondment of scientific staff. The<br>
Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at Sydney University ( Professor<br>
A. V. Stephens) would be chairman of the conference. The<br>
Australian delegates would be-<br>
The Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance of the R. A. A. F. ( Air<br>
Vice-Marshal E. C. Wackett), 3Mr. MI. B. Wnodlfill, of thie Division of Aircraft<br>
Production, the Chief of thie Division of Aero mautics of the Comncil for Scientific<br>
and Industrial Research ( Mr. L. IP. Coombesi.<br>
AERO CLUBS.<br>
On 16th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
In November, 1945, Cabinet approved assistance to aero clubs<br>
b. ubject to review after twelve months' operations.<br>
Cabinet to-day approved of recommendations for assistance for a<br>
period of four years and five months from February 1, 1947, to June<br>
1951, on terms and conditions to be determined by Mr. Drakeford<br>
and to be based generally on conditions originally -approved by<br>
Cabinet."".<br>

<p>37<br>
On 23rd March, 1948, the Minister for Civil Aviation ( Mr.<br>
Drakeford) announced details of increased subsidies to aero clubs.<br>
The scheme would operate from February, 1947, to June, 1951, and<br>
would cost œ 40,000 a year. It was designed to subsidize clubs at a rate<br>
of œ 1 14s. 6d. for every hour flown. That would be achieved as<br>
follows MlAINT1ENAZNcE GRAN-.-Increase from los. to œ 1 anll our for each hour flown.<br>
Previous limit of 200 hours an aircraft was removed, but there would be safeguards<br>
to prevent individual club members from enjoying unlimited pleasure<br>
flying at government expense. For flying away from home base, clubs would<br>
receive 30s. an hour South Australian and Tasmanian clubs would receive<br>
an hour for all flying until 30th June, 1948.<br>
Issua BoNus.-For each new pupil trained to "" All licence standard, the<br>
bonus would he increased from œ 50 to For pupils trained in country<br>
centres ( away from base) thre bonus would be raised from œ 60 to œ 90.<br>
B RENEWVAL BoNus.-For each licence renewed an club aircraft, the renewal<br>
bonus would be unchangaed at œ 10 for home base flying and œ 12 109. away from<br>
home base.<br>
RESERVE FOR BRPLACM[ ENT OF AxacmRrF.-The Government would accept a<br>
contingent liability to contribute at the rate of 10s. an hour towards the cost<br>
of replacement aircraft. Clubs would be required to build uip funds for thst<br>
: 1 purpose. ( ror earlier reference, please see No. 108, page 51.)<br>
COMMONWEALTH BANK.<br>
POLICY-ADVANCES.<br>
In Parlia-ment-On 10th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br>
N Chifley) said-<br>
"" The need to restrict the activities of non-essential enterprises must<br>
be apparent. In view of the shortage of labour and materials, it would<br>
hardly be proper to permit the erection of unnecessary structures such<br>
as picture theatres and amusement parks, thus diverting building<br>
materials from more undertakings such as housing. Actually there has<br>
been a substantial increase of bank advances in this country, as I shall<br>
show later by quoting figures. Let me first make this point clear: The<br>
instructions relating to advance policy have been issued at the instance<br>
of the Commonwealth Bank, but I say at once that they have the<br>
endorsement of the Government.<br>
"" Cabinet does not interfere with the policy of the Commonwealth<br>
Bank. When the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank put the posituated<br>
by excessive advances, I, as Treasurer, intimated on behalf of<br>
teGovernment that I endorsed the proposal. I say that the instructios<br>
wreissued with the full approval of the Governor of the CommonwalthBank;<br>
that they were discussed with him; and that on<br>
behalf of the Government I agreed with the bank's decision. With<br>
more than 200,000 people required to do essential work throughout<br>
this country, it would be highly undesirable for the Commonwealth<br>
Bank, through the private banks, to facilitate the expenditure of large<br>
sums of money on non-essential enterprises. The aim of the instructions<br>
is to ensure that the increased money being made available in<br>
bank advances shall be directed into -channels which will provide the<br>
greatest benefit to the community. </p>
<p>NT ~ 38<br>
"" The fact is that general advances have increased from<br>
œ 200,000,000 to œ 320,000,000 in two and a half years. Since June,<br>
1946, about nineteen months ago, the total has increased by<br>
œ 113,000,000. I emphasize that many trading companies want to carry<br>
on their businesses on bank advances instead of going to the public<br>
and getting the capital necessary for expansion. This is because interest<br>
rates are much lower than they were, and because companies<br>
can secure bank advances more cheaply than they can raise funds in<br>
other ways. There has been a tendency on the part of many firms<br>
to use bank advances even for the purpose of financing capital expenditure,<br>
which ought to be financed by calling up capital from the great<br>
amount of surplus money which is available in the community. There<br>
can be no question that there is an inflationary spiral, not a deflationary<br>
spiral, in the community.<br>
"" There has been a great and expanding spiral of advances in this<br>
country. There can he only one ultimate result to such a process if the<br>
money is used for purposes other than the legitimate expansion of<br>
production. An increasing amount of new credit is being made available.<br>
Whether it is made available by the Commonwealth Bank or<br>
by private banks does not matter; the effect with the community is<br>
precisely the same. The instructions were issued in the belief that<br>
the most disastrous thing that could happen to Australia to-day would<br>
he an inflation such as is occurring, in other countries. Inflation is<br>
almost as bad as deflation, because finally it brings about an economic<br>
collapse. Unless the national bank of any country exercises some<br>
control in periods of inflationary trends as well as in periods of deflationary<br>
trends, it does not do justice to the community. It must<br>
take steps to ensure that any unduly inflationary or deflationary movement<br>
is corrected.<br>
The Opposition cannot have it both ways by saying on one day<br>
that there should not be political interference with the banks and then,<br>
on another day, saying that directions as to the administrative policy<br>
of the Commonwealth Bank should come from this Parliament.<br>
The national income for 1947-48 is estimated at œ 200,000,000<br>
more than for 1946-47. The gross value of rural production is estimated<br>
this year at œ 537,000,000, an increase of œ 157,000,000 over the<br>
total of 1946-47. I need not go into details of wage earnings, hilt<br>
their rate is 20 per cent. above the rate for 1945-46. By the end of<br>
IDecember, 1948, it is likely to be 35 per cent. above the rate for 1945-46.<br>
Export prices in December, 1947, were 200 per cent. above the average<br>
level for the period 1936-39. There has been an increase of 44 per<br>
cent, since December, 1946. Wool prices in January, 1948, were 220<br>
per cent. above the 1936-39 level and were even 79 per cent. above the<br>
level which prevailed in January, 1947. Wheat prices in January,<br>
1948, were 400 per cent, above the 1936-39 level and were 94 per cent.<br>
above the January, 1947, level.<br>
"" These facts prove that a vast accumulation of money is flowing<br>
into the community. Whether this money comes in the form of wages,<br>
ieturns to wheat-rowers, or in other ways, it is clear that a great </p>
<p>number of. people in the community, instead of engaging in further<br>
speculative business, should be paying off some of the advances, made to<br>
them when there was not so much ready money available in the cornmunity<br>
as there is now. What we are faced with in Australia now is<br>
the opposite of deflation. That is proved by the fact that bank advances<br>
haeincreased by atotal of œ 200,000,000 in two and ahalf<br>
years. As I have often said, control of the Commonwealth Bank, or of<br>
any national bank, subject to over-all government policy, must be exercised<br>
to a fair degree by those persons who are responsible for its<br>
functions. They are in possession of the facts and figures necessary<br>
.1 for their guidance. I have cited some of those figures to-day, and I<br>
consider that what has been done by the bank is very wise in the light<br>
of existing economic circumstances.""<br>

TARIFF.<br>
CUSTOMS-BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 11th March, 1948, the Minister for Post-war<br>
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) -introduced the Customs Tariff Bill.<br>
The bill was passed.<br>

MINING.<br>
RADIO-ACTIVE MINERALS-THORIUM.<br>
On 16th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The Bureau of Mineral Resources -has carried out investigations<br>
for some time of beach sands along the coasts of northern New South<br>
Wales and -southern Queensland to assess their value as a potential<br>
source of radio-active minerals. Several companies have been engaged<br>
in processing the sands.<br>
"" Cabinet decided to-day that the bureau be authorized to carry<br>
out expenditure to conserve thorium-bearing minerals.""<br>
MIGRATION.<br>
ALLIED SERVICEMEN, ASSISTED PAS-SAGES.<br>
On 16th March, 1948, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)<br>
said-Ex-service personnel, with their dependants, who served during<br>
World War II. in the armed forces or merchant navies or resistande<br>
movements of Holland, Belgium, France, Norway and Denmark will<br>
subject to the usual immigration -requirements and security checks, be<br>
eligible for assisted passages. Nationals of Holland, Belgium, France,<br>
Nor-way and Denmark, with their dependants, who served during<br>
World War II. in the armed forces or merchant navies of British<br>
Empire countries or the United States will be included.<br>
Under the scheme, the Commonwealth Government will contributeup<br>
to 40 per cent. of the tourist class fare or œ stg. 30 towards the cost </p>
<p>of the fares of adult migrants and amounts ranging from 45 to 100 per<br>
cent. ( with a minimum of œ 17 10s. and a maximum -of E35) towards<br>
the fares of dependent children.""<br>
GOVERNMENT POLICY-ITALY, ROUMANIA, BULGARIA,<br>
IHUNGARY.<br>
On 24th March, 1948, Mr. Calwell announced that, following the<br>
ratification of peace treaties with Italy, Roumania, Bulgaria and Rungary,<br>
it had been decided to modify the policy governing the entry of<br>
nationals of those countries into Australia. At present, only persons<br>
who were the wives, unmarried daughters or minor unmarried sons of<br>
residents of Australia were eligible for admission. Under the modified<br>
policy, Italians, Roumanians, Bulgarians and Hungarians might be<br>
admitted if skilled in undernamed trades or professions, or suited for<br>
and would engage in occupations in which there was a definite shortage<br>
of labour, and came within certain age limits. A system of priorities<br>
would operate-<br>
Persons classed as essential workers, nominated and to be found accommodation<br>
by residents in Australia.<br>
Persons nominated find to be found accommodation by Australian residents,<br>
and to engage in employment which was undermanned.<br>
Single persons without noiiators in Australia, who would engage in<br>
essential employment and for whom accommodation could readily be found.<br>
Certain preferences would apply within the priorities. First preference<br>
would go to migrants who were suited for, and engage in,<br>
rural work such as farm labourers, cane cutters, timber cutters.<br>
Second preference would be granted to those who would be employed in<br>
occupations which would help to relieve the housing shortage such<br>
as the production of building materials and housing construction<br>
projects. Third preference would go to those who would engage in<br>
work connected with national undertakings in rural districts such as<br>
water conservation, electricity projects, road and rail construction.<br>
It would be a condition of admission in every case that the migrant<br>
would engage in the class of work for which he was nominated and<br>
would remain in the dietrict to w~ hich -he was assigned for two years.<br>
At the end of that period, those who proved themselves satisfactory<br>
migrants would be allowed to remain permanently. Any who did not<br>
observe the conditions would be liable to summary deportation.<br>
* DEPARTMENT OF SUPPLY AND SHIPPING.<br>
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.<br>
On 16th March, 1913, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" The Supply and Development Act of 1939 constituted the Department<br>
of Supply and Development, its functions being the provision or<br>
supply of munitions; the manufacture or assembly of aircraft or<br>
parts thereof; extension of industries for purposes of defence;<br>
acquisition, maintenance and disposal -of stocks of goods in connexion<br>
with defence; and surveys of Australian industrial capacity and the </p>
<p>investigation and development of Australian sources of supply of goods<br>
necessary for the economic security of the Commonwealth in time of<br>
war. "" In 1940, munitions and aircraft production activities were transferred<br>
by National Security ( Munitions) Regulations to a new Department<br>
of Munitions. In 1942, the shipping and associated functions of<br>
the Departments of Labour * and National Service, Commerce and<br>
Agriculture, and Trade and Customs were transferred to the Department<br>
of Supply and Development, the title being altered to that of<br>
Supply and Shipping.<br>
"" Cabinet decidcd to-day that legislation be prepared -to amend the<br>
Supply and Development Act to repeal the National Security<br>
( Munitions) Regulations, the effect being to restore the Supply w~<br>
Development ' Act to the position it originally held in 1939.""<br>
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.<br>
AWARDS FOR GALLANTRY.<br>
On 17th March, 1943, the Governor-General announced the award<br>
of the Distinguished Service Order to Air Vice-Marshal W. D. Bostock.<br>
NATIONALITY,<br>
UNIFORMITY-PROPOSED LEGISLATION.<br>
On 18th March, 1948, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)<br>
announced that legislation would be prepared to confer on Australians<br>
the status of Australian citizenship in addition to, and not as distinct<br>
from, the general status of British subject. The British Government<br>
had introduced the British Nationality Bill in February, 1948, givingeffect<br>
to the principle that the people of each of the self-governing<br>
countries within the British Commonwealth should have both a<br>
particular status as citizens of their own country and a common status<br>
as members of the wider association of peoples comprising the Commonwealth.<br>
In 1946, the Canadian Government had enacted legislation<br>
which came into operation on 1st January, 1947, to provide for the<br>
grant of Canadian citizenship, combined with the maintenance of the<br>
status of British subject. NEW ZEALAND.<br>
VISIT OF NEW ZEALAIND GOVERNOR-GENERAL.<br>
On. 19th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" I have extended an invitation, through the Governor-General ( Mr-<br>
Mc~ ell), to the Prime Minister of New Zealand ( Mr. Fraser) for the<br>
Governor-General of New Zealand ( General Sir Bernard Frayberg,<br>
to visit Australia later this year </p>
<p>42<br>
PRICES.<br>
GOODS "" DECLARED ""-SERVICES, REVOCATION.<br>
On 19th March, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)<br>
announced that services supplied or carried on by certain nonproprietary<br>
organizations not conducted for private gain had been<br>
removed from price control. These were-<br>
Services supplied or carried on by a society or association, not being a society<br>
or association carried on for the purposes of profit or gain to the individual<br>
members thereof:-<br>
Registered under the law of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth<br>
relating to friendly societies;<br>
Being a trade union or an association of employers or employees<br>
registered under any Act of the Commonwealth or a State or any<br>
O rdinance of a Territory of the Commonwealth relating to the settlement<br>
of industrial disputes;<br>
Established to promote the development of aviation or of the agricultural<br>
or viticultural or industrial resources of Australia;<br>
Established for musical purposes, or for the encouragement of music,<br>
art or literature;<br>
Established for the purposes of any athletic game or sport, or for the<br>
encouragement or control of any athletic game or sport.<br>
One effcect of the decision would be to remove from control admission<br>
charges to many sporting events, musical shows and other entertainment<br>
and functions but would apply only to events conducted purely for the<br>
encouragement or control of the sport or art. Charges for boxing<br>
matches, cinema and theatrical shows and horse, dog and motor racing,<br>
if run for commercial gain, would still be subject to control.<br>
PALESTI NE.<br>
UNITED NATIONS DECISION-MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br>
On 22nd March, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br>
Evatt) said-<br>
"" Decision of a competent international conference should be<br>
accepted after there has been full inquiry and fair debate and a just<br>
settlement has been reached. Accordingly, any setting aside of the<br>
United Nations Assembly decision on Palestine must be closely<br>
scrutinized. It is impossible to examine the new plan in detail because nothing<br>
definite is known about it. It is said that trusteeship will be the new<br>
solution. But the word itself is ambiguous. What does it mean?<br>
It certainly seems to imply that the peoples to be placed under trusteeship<br>
are not sufficiently advanced for self-government. Such a<br>
suggestion would seem to be untenable in relation either to the<br>
Palestinian Arabs or to the Palestinian Jews.<br>
If, however, what is now proposed is a temporary United Nations<br>
trusteeship merely to carry out the Assembly's decisions, it would be a<br>
very different matter. But is that intended?<br>
"" The final decision was reached in December, 1947, after two<br>
General Assemblies had dealt most carefully and exhaustively with the<br>
Y matter, after all parties were heard, and after a special commission </p>
<p>43<br>
involving very heavy United Nations expenditure had visited Palestine<br>
and reported in favour of the principle of the plan ultimately adopted in<br>
the Assembly. The plan adopted is inappropriately labelled partition'<br>
because it involves four separate points: first, economic union of the<br>
whole of Palestine under the control of an authority with a majority<br>
of ' United Nations membership; second, political division of Palestine<br>
into two new States, Jewish and Arab; third, United Nations trusteeship<br>
over Jerusalem and Bethlehem; fourth, four safeguards for the<br>
holy places and especially for the Christian churches throughout -the<br>
whole of Palestine.<br>
"" The only alternative plan suggested to the Assembly was to<br>
establish a unitary State under Arab domination with no a dequat<br>
safeguards for the protection either of the Jewish peoples or of th'.<br>
Jewish churches. This alternative was plainly inadmissible and was<br>
rejected by an overwhelming majority. The United Nations decision<br>
was reached by more than a two-thirds majority, the only dissentients<br>
being the Arab States and certain nations very closely associated with<br>
them. The decision was just and impartial and must not be lightly set<br>
aside. The United Nations did not intermeddle in the Palestine matter.<br>
It intervened only after the British Government had specially requested<br>
the United Nations Assembly to handle the matter as all previous efforts<br>
at reconciliation between the Arabs and Jews had entirely failed. At<br>
the United Nations, the British Government did not itself propose any<br>
solution and announced it would accept the United Nations decision.<br>
In the circumstances, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New<br>
Zealand all supported the proposal finally adopted. After all that has<br>
occurred, to throxv the solution into the melting pot again may be very<br>
damaging to the authority of the United Nations.<br>
It has been contended that the enforcement of the Assembly's<br>
decision is not possible. Had the great powers who supported the proposal<br>
at Lake Success, New York, adhered firmly to it, there probably<br>
would have been little difficulty. In any event, under the Assembly's<br>
decision, the new Jewish State and the new Arab States were each to be<br>
entitled to establish its own militia forces for the defence of the new<br>
territories, and this decision clearly carried with it the right of Jews<br>
as well as Arabs to import arms and equipment for the purposes of<br>
defence. It is impossible to pass final judgment on the new proposal because<br>
no one has explained it as yet.<br>
I was chairman of the committee which worked assiduously to<br>
obtain a just solution. The committee repeatedly modified its proposals<br>
at the suggestion of the mandatory power in order that Britain should<br>
be able to withdraw its forces after its long, its thankless, but on the<br>
whole successful development of the Palestine area since it was captured<br>
from the Turks by British and Australian forces in 1918. </p>
<p>44<br>
"" In my opinion, the United Nations decision has been graduallyundermined<br>
by intrigues directed against the Jewish people. It would<br>
be little short of a tragedy if the fundamental right of self-government<br>
were to be denied to the Jews and Arabs, as it is guaranteed to them.<br>
under the Assembly decision just as religious freedom is also guaranteed<br>
td the Christian Church throughout Palestine.<br>
The only considerations that influenced the United Nations<br>
Assembly were those of justice and fair dealing to all concerned. It<br>
would be most disturbing if mere consideration of power politics orexpediency<br>
were allowed to detroy the decision. However, if a special<br>
-United Nations Assembly is called, it is hardly likely to accept any new<br>
? Ian which involved a repudiation of the previous decision, unless new<br>
facts of overwhelming cogency are proved to exist. I need hardly add'<br>
that, under the United Nations Charter, the Security Council seem's to<br>
have no power whatever to overrule the recommendation of the-<br>
Assembly ( For earlier reference, please see No. 130, page 37.)<br>

EXPEDITION-PROGRESS.<br>
On 11th December, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br>
Evatt) announced that the Wyatt Earp, mother ship of the Australian<br>
National Antarctic Research Expedition, would leave on 13th December,<br>
1947, for a summer reconnaissance along the Australian sector of<br>
the Antarctic Continent.<br>
On 15th December, 1947, Dr. Evatt announced that the advance<br>
unit of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition reached<br>
Hleard Island on l1th December, 1947, and had established a food<br>
-depot. On 2nd January, 1948, Dr. Evatt announced that the Wyatt Easy<br>
had been recalled to Melbourne by the. naval authorities. The vessel<br>
had developed a leak in the hull which made it necessary for her to be<br>
overhauled in dry dock.<br>
On 25th January, 1948, Dr. Evatt said that he had conferred with<br>
the Leader of the Australian Antarctic, Expedition ( Group-Captain<br>
S. A. Campbell) who had reported to him the recommendations of the<br>
Planning Committee which had -met on 23rd January, 1948. He had<br>
approved variations in the programme of the expedition for the<br>
remainder of the summer as proposed by the committee. The committee<br>
had considered a report by the Department of the Navy regarding the<br>
condition of the Wyatt Earp which had been in dock undergoing repairs<br>
following her recall from Antarctic waters. Naval authorities were<br>
satisfied that the Wyatt Earp was fully capable of carrying out her<br>
duties. The Wyatt Earp would, subject to comprehensive trials being<br>
successfully completed, leave Melbourne about 6th February, 1948, to<br>
carry out reconnaissance in the eastern sector -of the Australian<br>
Antarctic territory. If practicable, the old magnetic station at Commonwealth<br>
Bay would he re-occupied, or magnetic observations would<br>
be taken in some other suitable region. On the return journey, the<br>
Wyatt Earjs would visit the IBalleny Islands and make a survey.<br>
The Naval landing craft LST3501 had received damage to her<br>
plates at Heard Island. She would go into dry dock and would leave<br>
for Macquarie Island during the last week in February to land a party<br>
, of fourteen scientists to stay there during winter.<br>

AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.<br>
AWARDS FOR GALLANTRY.<br>
On 11th December, 1947, the Governor-General announced the award<br>
of the George Cross to Captain L. C. Matthews. </p>
<p>MILITARY BOARD-APiPOINTMENT.<br>
On 4th February, 1948, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Chambers)<br>
announced the appointment of Major-General G. F. Wootten as a member<br>
of the Military Board, as an officer of the Citizen Military Forces.<br>
( For earlier references, please see No. 108, page 17; No. 110, page 8.)<br>
FIGHTING FORCES.<br>
RECONSTRUCTION TRAINING SCHEME-FIGURES.<br>
On 11th December, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)<br>
said that the present position of the Commonwealth Reconstruction<br>
Training Scheme for post-discharged ex-service personnel was-<br>
Total number accepted for training to 31st October, 1947-Full-timne training<br>
68,313, part-time and by correspondence 138,273, total 206,588.<br>
Total number commenced courses as at 31st October, 1947-Full-time training<br>
48,846, part-time training 125,227, total 174,073.<br>
Total number completed and at work at 31st October, 1947-33,205.<br>
The difference between the 174,073 and the 33,205 ( with the exclusion<br>
of those who changed their minds or left their State or country)<br>
were going through their courses.<br>

. PETROL SUPPLIES.<br>
RATIONING SYSTEM-REDUCTION, DECEMBER, 1947.<br>
On 11th D~ ecember, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" It -is imperative that the cut of 10 per cent. in petrol, effective<br>
from 1st January, 1948, should be very real and reflect itself immiediately<br>
in the monthly consumption of -petrol through Australia. The<br>
Government realizes that there may be some very exceptional cases<br>
where special licenees will need to be grantcd to compensate for a portion<br>
of the cut. However, such licences will be granted only in the most<br>
exceptional circumstances and there will be no possibility of granting<br>
special licences to class 2 ( private motorists) and classes 3-7, including<br>
business cars and business-pleasure groups.<br>
The Government is doing its utmost under very difficult circumstances.<br>
Its objeetive is to spread the sacrifice over the whole community.<br>
The Government asks consumers to play their part and<br>
rigidly confine their purchases to the reduced licence gallonage under<br>
the new scale.""<br>
On 12th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
A satisfactory arrangement has -been concluded with the oil industry<br>
for the checking of resellers' petrol coupons at the oil companies'<br>
main terminals and branch offices. This work will be carried out under<br>
the supervision of the Liquid Fuel Control Board inspectors. As a </p>
<p>result of this arrangement, the coupon system will be brought under<br>
complete control and coupons surrendered by resellers on receipt of<br>
deliveries into their tanks will be checked and verified within a few<br>
days after the date of each sale. Advices are being issued by the companies<br>
to the resellers of the new arrangements, which become effective<br>
immediately. It will be necessary for resellers to return their coupons in<br>
bundles of uniform quantity ( say 100 gallons) and each denomination<br>
will need to be kept separately. Liquid Fuel Boards are being instructed<br>
to take immediate action direct with resellers in the event of any inaccuracies<br>
being detected. The reselling of petrol will, like other<br>
rationing, be under an imprest system and any deficiencies will be<br>
deducted from the immediately following delivery into resellers' tanks<br>
OIL-SYNTHETIC PRODUCTION.<br>
On 12th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
In May, 1947, following consideration of the matter by the Minister<br>
for Supply ( Senator Ashley), the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction<br>
( Mr. Dedman) and myself, an inter-departmental committee<br>
was appointed to report to Cabinet on the general problems of fuel<br>
research in Australia.<br>
Cabinet to-day considered the committee's report which stated<br>
that, at this stage, it was unable to recommend any concrete proposals<br>
for the production of synthetic fuels. It considered it was impossible to<br>
decide what experiments should be undertaken. until extensive investigations<br>
had taken place both in Australia and overseas.<br>
Cabinet adopted the following recommendations-in regard to the<br>
administrative organization considered desirable to enable the formulation<br>
and development of future fuel policy-<br>
The Department of Supply to be given the initial administrati. e responsibility<br>
for the formulation, for the consideration of Cabinet, of Commonwealth<br>
policy in regard to fuel development; and the administration of such fuel<br>
development or production projects as the Commonwealth may control, either<br>
alone or in collaboration with other Commonwealth Departments or with one<br>
or more States.<br>
The responsible department to take such action as may be consid. red necessary<br>
to have the question of whether or not the production of synthetic fuels<br>
should be undertaken in Australia examined so that advice may be , ive. to<br>
Cabinet on the policy it should follow.<br>
It is proposed that the Department of Supply will work in close<br>
association with a section of the Council for Scientific and Industrial<br>
Research being established to engage in scientific research into fuel<br>
problems. A small mission, comprising two officers selected by arrangement<br>
with the Department of ' Supply and the Council for Scientific<br>
and Industrial Research, will be sent abroad in the near future to carry<br>
out investigations on the basis of which it will be possible to formulate<br>
sound recommendations as to future fuel policy."" </p>
<p>BRITAIN.<br>
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS.<br>
On 14th December, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt), the Minister for<br>
Supply (. Senator Ashley), the Minister for Health ( Senator McKenna),<br>
the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard), the Minister for Customs<br>
( Senator Courtice) and myself conferred to-night on the basis to be<br>
adopted for the issue of new import licences for dollar goods to he<br>
imported before 30th June, 1948.<br>
For the past two months there has been virtually a suspension of<br>
the issue of import licences for dollar goods. Following consideration of<br>
a report by the special inter-departmental committee, it has now been<br>
decided to resume the issue of licences. A maximum ceiling figure of<br>
very limited extent has been established for the value of new\ licences<br>
for goods to be imported from the dollar area before 30th June, 1948.<br>
This figure has been allocated over the various classes of goods and the<br>
Minister for Customs will issue licences only in accordance with the<br>
allocation. It must be emphasized that dollar licences to be issued for<br>
importation before 30th June, 1948, will be confined to goods of the very<br>
highest essentiality and the quantities of even these goods will necessarily<br>
be severely limited<br>
On 9th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Much as the Australian Government regrets liavinz to impose<br>
restrictions on dollar imports, this action has been necessary if Australia<br>
is to assist Britain in its present economic difficulti: es. Any failure by<br>
Britain to meet the position that confronts it would have very disturbing<br>
economic results for Australia and the other Dominions. Therefore,<br>
in our own material interests-apart from sentiment and kinship<br>
-Australia must do everything she can to assist the Mother Country<br>
On 22nd January, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator<br>
Courticc) said that licensing of goods originating in the dollar area for<br>
importation on or before 30th June, 1948, was being confined to indispensable<br>
goods to ensure that the limited amount of dollars allocated<br>
by the Government for new licences was not exceeded. Licensing of<br>
goods to be imported from dollar countries during 1948-49 would be<br>
oporated on a budget quota system related to imports during 1946-47.<br>
Each importer should, before 13th February, 1948, furnish to State<br>
Collectors of Customs statements, supported by a statutory declaration,<br>
showing-TIlportations of dol! ar area origin during the period of eighteen months<br>
Irultd 31st December, 1947, according to the individual specifications; and<br>
!' Piltienlars of the quantities and value outstandin as at Ist . lunaIry,<br>
19! k. on all valid licences issued for goods of dollar area origin including tho'e<br>
,,' olds in respect of which statements of importations are not required.<br>
Licences would not be issued to those importers who failed to furnish<br>
the required statements of imports and outstanding licences.<br>

<p>FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS, PRIME<br>
MINISTER'S BROADCAST.<br>
On 26th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley broadcast over the National<br>
network. Mr. Chidley said-<br>
"" Recently, as you know, the Government has imposed further<br>
restrictions on dollar imports and, in one way or another, these restrictions<br>
will affect most of you. You have, therefore, a right to be satisfied<br>
that they are unavoidable and that they serve a real purpose. My desire<br>
is to explain the position to you as simply as I possibly can.<br>
In Australia we require dollars to pay for American and Canadian<br>
good( s-uch as newsprint, cotton textiles, tobacco, motor chassis, and<br>
various kinds of machinery. There are also items such a freight, film<br>
royalties and a certain amount of interest on Australian Government<br>
loans in New York. We earn some of these dollars by selling to the<br>
United States and Canada commodities such as wool, rabbit-skins,<br>
canned fruits and so on. But in most years we do not earn as many<br>
dollars as we spend. For example, during the last trade year, 1946-47,<br>
we received round about 190,000,000 dollars and spent about<br>
290.000,000 dollars, so that there was a gap of about 100,000,000 dollars.<br>
Even before the war we earned less dollars than we spent. Then,<br>
however, Britain was able to provide us with sufficient dollars to make<br>
up the difference. Shel sold us these dollars for sterling-English<br>
pounds, that i. Therefore, so long as we could earn enough sterling,<br>
we were able to obtain the extra dollars we required. That position has<br>
greatly changed. Britain is not able to earn sufficient dollars to buy the<br>
things she wants herself. She has, therefore, to restrict the importation<br>
of goods from dollar sources and that imposes severe hardships on<br>
her people. It follows that Britain is not able to sell us all the dollars<br>
we require. . She is still selling us some of her dollars, but every additional<br>
demand we make on her means that she has to deny her people<br>
things that they need. It is true that Britain still has some reserves<br>
but they are being rapidly used up. After the war she borrowed about<br>
five billion dollars from the United States and Canada. But practically<br>
all that lhas now been spent.<br>
This situation has come about mainly in two ways. On the one<br>
hand, Britain needs goods from the United States and Canada to a far<br>
greater value than the goods she can sell there. Her industries need a<br>
great deal of re-equipping, after being damaged by bombs and worn<br>
generally during the war. Her export trade fell away by two-t ' rds<br>
largely because so much of her industry was diverted to war product on.<br>
She lost a great part of her shipping and sold most of her overs as<br>
investments to pay for war supplies. By great efforts and much se'fdenial<br>
on the part of her people, her exports have been increased, b,: t<br>
not far enough to pay for the goods she needs. Most of those exports<br>
go to countries which pay in currencies that cannot be changed into<br>
dollars. </p>
<p>On the other hand, many other countries look to Britain to provide<br>
them with dollars. All those countries devastated by the war need great<br>
quantities of plant and materials to re-build their industries. Some<br>
still more urgently need foodstuffs and the other necessaries of life,<br>
because their people are barely keeping ahead of starvation. These<br>
countries are all seeking supplies from the United States, but none of<br>
them has enough dollars to pay for the American goods they want nor<br>
enough goods of their own to export in return for American goods.<br>
For a time after the war the gap was partly bridged by loans from<br>
the United States and Canada and relief contributions such as Unrra.<br>
These resources could not have been more than a stop-gap and they have<br>
now come pretty well to an end.<br>
"" A number of countries have balances of English money to their<br>
credit at London and nearly all countries acquire a certain amount of<br>
English money in the course of their trade. To get American supplies,<br>
these countries seek to change some of their sterling resources into<br>
dollars. Thus, over and above providing dollars for her own needs,<br>
Britain has to try to provide dollars for a large part of the trading<br>
work, including ourselves. Britain could meet this dollar deficiency<br>
only by borrowing or by drawing on her gold reserves. Actually she has<br>
done both.<br>
"" As I have mentioned, the United States and Canada made loans<br>
to Britain totalling about five billion dollars. These loans were intended<br>
to fill the gap between dollar earnings and dollar expenditure until<br>
Britain could get on her feet.<br>
But whereas the United States loan of 3,750,000,000 dollars was<br>
expected to last two or three years, most of it was actually spent in<br>
about one year. During the same period, Britain was also drawing<br>
heavily against the Canadian loan. One reason for this rapid using-up<br>
of dollars was that American prices rose steeply, making the materials<br>
bought by Britain very much dearer. Another reason was the bad<br>
setback to British industry through the severe winter of 1946, which<br>
checked export production. Then, as the United States loan began to<br>
run out, a number of countries sought to convert large amounts of<br>
English money into dollars within a short period and this increased<br>
greatly the rate of drawings against what remained of the loans.<br>
Britain, therefore, has had to face the necessity of drawing on her gold<br>
reserves, which, by pre-war standards, are already very low. How low<br>
they are we have lately been told by the British Chancellor of the<br>
Exchequer ( Sir Stafford Cripps). He said in a statement to the House<br>
of Commons on the 19th December that, at the end of 1947, Britain's<br>
overseas reserves were expected to be about œ 500,000,000 sterling. He<br>
has since told us that the rate of drain on these resources is still proceeding<br>
at the rate of œ 11,000,000 sterling a week. Clearly this could<br>
not go on for too long. </p>
<p>"" I needl only add that even the œ 500,000,000 mentioned by the<br>
Chancellor cannot be regarded as wholly available for spending because<br>
sonme part of it would havc to he held as a bedrock ro'serv-e against<br>
eincrg-enccs and to provide a mninimum wvorking fund for trade purposes.<br>
Clearly this very small mrargin of reserves must he very carefully<br>
husbanded. If the bedrock limit were reached, all the countries<br>
which now obtain dollars through Britain would have to live within<br>
their day-to-day earnings of dollars and this would cause acute difficulties<br>
for the individual countries-for ourselves perhaps as much as<br>
.1115oyn e.<br>
"" As I have said, we have to call on Britain in most years for<br>
dollars to balance our accounts with the United States and Canada. The<br>
amount varies from year to year and depends largely on how much we<br>
sell to the United States and Canada. Wool is the main item at present.<br>
We , sold a lot of wool to America last year at high prices. This year<br>
weO will sell rather less, and although wool prices has risen, our total<br>
dollar earnings will be somewhat less than last year.<br>
If wool prices fall, our total dollar earnings might be a good deal<br>
less and wve would either has to ask the British Government for large<br>
amounts of dollars or else cut dollar imports very drastically indeed.<br>
"" Since much that we buy from the United States is essential to the<br>
rining of our economny and to our future development we naturally<br>
do not wanit to cut dollar imports too far. And yet, as things stand, We<br>
cannot expect to draw more than a minimium * amount from the shrinking<br>
dollar reserves available to Britain. That, briefly, is the crux of<br>
our present position.<br>
"" Britain has taken the main burden of the dollar shortage so far.<br>
They have cut their dollar imports very rigorously, even going' to the<br>
length of reducing their food rations still further. But the other<br>
sterling area countries-ourselves among them-must share this burden<br>
with them. This is not a mere matter of sentiment, but one of sheer, hard<br>
ncecessity. We simply could not afford to see Britain's dollar reserves run<br>
out. Therefore we must do onr very utmost in a practical way, on the<br>
one hand, to earn more dollars and, on the other hand, to save more<br>
dollars. Even with the cuts imposed, and even though we are selling'<br>
our current gold production abroad, we will not earn nearly as many<br>
dollars as we spend this year. There will still be an appreciable gap<br>
for which we must draw on Britain's dollar reserves. But we hope<br>
gradually to reduce that gap as the months go by.<br>
The action taken has inevitably caused a good deal of inconvenience<br>
and some dislocation to trade and industry. The Government<br>
regrets this but there was no way to avoid it. Even now it is estimated<br>
that dollar imports for 1947-48 will reach a total of œ A901000,000 a<br>
against œ A63,000,000 for 1946-47. </p>
<p>Since the basic problem behind the dollar shortage is that of<br>
reviving the war damaged economies of the world, we cannot expect any<br>
spectacular improvement within the near future. Those countries have<br>
made some progress since the war ended but it has been relatively slow.<br>
Their problems cannot be solved merely by outside help. The main<br>
effort must come from themselves.<br>
"" Nevertheless, outside help is necessary and that is the reason for<br>
further United States help under what is known as the Marshall Plan.<br>
This is a proposal which aims to provide these crippled countries with<br>
the materials they require to step up their production, the idea being<br>
that if they can once get into their stride again they will be able to<br>
keep moving. If the plan is approved by Congress and is put into<br>
operation, Britain should benefit, both directly and indirectly. lcecovery<br>
in Europe would mean that supplies of goods which she now has to buy<br>
with dollars would become available to her from European countries.<br>
Sir Stafford Cripps has said that Britain could look forvward to<br>
some benefit of this kind in the latter half of 1948 if the AMarshall<br>
Plan had by then come into operation. But that is some way ahead<br>
yet and, in the meantime, the dollar problem! u for Britain, and for us too,<br>
is a pretty difficult job of making ends meet.<br>
"" We can play our part in two main ways. One is to go carefully<br>
with all forms of dollar expenditure. This particularly is a matter in<br>
which business firms and individual citizens call do a good deal to help.<br>
The other is to produce and export all we can, not only of goods which<br>
can be sold for dollars but of goods which sterling area countries would<br>
otherwise have to buy for dollars. The Government is going very<br>
closely into the question of increasing exports along these lines and it<br>
may be possible to do a good deal, particularly if we have further good<br>
seasons. It is, of course, more satisfactory. to earn more dollars by<br>
increasing exports than to save them by reducing imlports-although<br>
as matters stand we must do our utmost at both. In expanding exports,<br>
however, we have to keep in mind the essential needs of our own plcoplC.<br>
Since world conditions underlying the dollar shortage will take.<br>
time to remedy, it would be wrong for me to hold out the prospect that<br>
import restrictions will soon be lifted or eased. We cannot ignore the<br>
possibility that some of these restrictions may have to be tightened<br>
further. That will not be done, however, unless it is absolutely<br>
inevitable. We have very great interests at stake in this matter because our<br>
overseas trade depends fundamentally on world economic conditions<br>
and above all on the strength and welfare of Britain which, these days,<br>
is hard-pressed to maintain the standards of living of her people. We<br>
all want to help her to win through. As a major exporting country we<br>
can do much by increasing the quantity of foodstuffs and other materials<br>
we send abroad. We can also help by economizing in the use of scarce<br>
dollar commodities. I put it to you that there is a job in this for every<br>
one in Australia </p>
<p>FINANCIAL POLICY-STERLING, DEVALUATION.<br>
On 24th January, 194S, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
If the International Monetary Fund agrees to devaluation of<br>
the French franc, the method of devaluation is important to Australia,<br>
as a problem cilhi arise regarding relationship of our currency with<br>
sterling. If the de\ valuation is carried out in certain ways, it could<br>
result in a weakening of sterling, and if that resulted in a depreciation<br>
of British currency, a problem affecting Australia could arise.<br>
There have been no consultations with the Australian Government<br>
as to devaluation of the irane, but there must be consultations with the<br>
International Monetary Fund if devaluation is more than 10 per cent.<br>
The move will have no effect on United States aid to Britain. It is a<br>
purely French problem.<br>
The real danger i~ the establishment of a double franc'-similar<br>
to the ' double ire in Italy-which means that some proceeds of<br>
FreniOi exports, would go to the French Treasury, while some would be<br>
free for exporters. This would result in a ' cross rate' of the franc<br>
against the dollar and the pound sterling. This could result in some<br>
weakening of sterling, and depreciation of sterling would set for us<br>
the problem of whether we would depreciate our currency in line with<br>
sterling. There can be no answe. r until these circumstances eventuate,<br>
bht that is the problem which might arise<br>
On 29th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
No consideration has been give. n to altering the Australian excli1ngp<br>
rate while sterling remains at its present value. Only in the<br>
event of a depreciation of sterling would the matter be considered.<br>
Tlhre have been no consultations with the British Treasury on the exchange<br>
rate.<br>
The Australian Government shares with the British Chancellor<br>
of the Exchequer ( Sir Stafford Cripps) his fears as to the dangers<br>
which may arise in regard to the French open market for gold and<br>
certain foreign currencies, unless strictly administered<br>

LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH BRITAIN-EXTENSION.<br>
On 15th December, 1947, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard)<br>
announced that the Government had completed negotiations for an<br>
extension for two years of the long-term contract with the British<br>
Government for the purchase of Australian meat. The original contract<br>
was for four years ending 30th . September, 1948. Prices which<br>
operated during the period October, 1946, to September, 1947, would<br>
continue to operate for the October, 1947-September, 1948, period but<br>
provision has been made in the new agreement for pig meat prices to be<br>
subject to annual price review.<br>

COMMONWEALTH BANK.<br>
POLICY-ADVANCES.<br>
On 18th December, 1947, the Acting Prime Minister ( Dr. Evatt)<br>
said-The instruction recently issued by the Commonwealth Bank to<br>
trading banks with regard to advance policy is similar to instructions<br>
issued by the Commonwealth Bank from time to time on the same subject<br>
since the early years of the war. During the past two and a half<br>
years the trading banks have increased from œ 200,000,000 to<br>
œ 320,000,000. The increase has been particularly rapid during 1947.<br>
Since December, 1946, trading bank advances have increased by<br>
œ 65,000,000. The Commonwealth Bank has facilitated this expansion<br>
by appropriate central bank action. The Government has endorsed<br>
the policy because it considered that the banks should be allowed to<br>
finance the re-conversion of industries from a war footing to peace-time<br>
production, to expand productive capacity for essential purposes and to<br>
assist the re-stocking of farm and station properties.<br>
"" Recently a large amount of free money has been available in<br>
the open market for investment, largely because of the exceptional prices<br>
for export commodities and because of the influx of overseas capital.<br>
The existence of this free money was shown by the fact that the Fourth<br>
Security Loan was over-subscribed by œ 13,000,000. The Commonwealth<br>
Bank therefore considers that while funds are so readily available in the<br>
market for investment purposes, it is unnecessary and inadvisable that<br>
bank advances should continue to increase as rapidly as in recent months.<br>
In present circumstances, the Commonwealth Bank considers that<br>
capital expansion should be financed by new issues and not by bank<br>
overdrafts. Accordingly, in its revised instructions to the banks it has<br>
called for a somewhat stricter application of the principles which have<br>
formed the basis of its earlier instructions </p>
<p>WHEAT.<br>
SALE TO BRITAIN.<br>
On 18th December. 1947, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard)'<br>
announced that the Government had completed negotiations with the<br>
British Governmuent in regard to the supply of wheat and flour from the<br>
1947-4S wheat crop. The Government had accepted the offer of the<br>
British Government for the purchase of 30,000,000 bushels of wheat<br>
at the overall price of A. 17s. a bushel, f. o. b. Australian ports. Thequantity<br>
represented shipments destined for British requirements and<br>
in addition the needs of colonial and other areas for whose wheat<br>
supplies Britain was responsible. The latter shipments would comprise'<br>
mostly flour. Because of the magnitude of the deal and the fact that<br>
the British Ministry of Food would provide shipping to lift all the<br>
wheat and flour over a period of thirteen months, the Government was<br>
justified in accepting the maximum offer which the British Government<br>
was prepared to make. The Government felt that a contract for sucha<br>
huge quantity should not be made on a quarterly price basis, particularly<br>
in view of market fluctuations which could occur over a period<br>
of twelve months.<br>
A clause in the contract provided for an additional allocation of<br>
5,000,000 bushels in the event that receivals by the board from the.<br>
1947-43 harvest reached 210,000,000 bushels of f. a. q. wheat. The price<br>
would be subject to review in the event of the participants to thecontract<br>
becoming parties to an international wheat agreement if and<br>
when made. Under those circumstances, the price of wheat remaining<br>
unshipped at the date the international wheat agreement came into force,<br>
would be adjusted to conform to the price operating under the international<br>
agreement. SALE TO INDIA.<br>
On 18th December, 1947, Mr. Pollard announced the conclusion of<br>
negotiations with representatives of the Indian Food Mission for the<br>
purchase of wheat on behalf of the Indian Government. The Government<br>
would sell to India from the 1947-48 wheat crop 25,000,000 bushels<br>
of wheat, including the flour equivalent of 2,500,000 bushels. The price<br>
would be on the basis of Ai8s. 6d. a bushel, f. o. b. Australian ports, with<br>
delivery spread over twelve months.<br>
A clause in the contract provided for an additional allocation of*<br>
5,000,000 bushels in the event that receivals by the board from the<br>
1947-43 harvest reached 210,000,000 bushels of f. a. q. wheat. The<br>
price would be subject to review in the event of the participants to the<br>

<p>INDIA.<br>
AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIFIC MISSION TO INDIA.<br>
On 21st December, 1947, the Acting Prime Minister ( Dr. Evatt)<br>
said-"" A mission of Australian scientifists will shortly visit India. During<br>
the Empire Scientific Conference at London in 1946, many contacts<br>
were made between Indian and Australian scientists and, as a result,<br>
the Government of India has invited the Australian Government to send<br>
a goodwill mission to India to visit the main centres of University and<br>
Government research in that Dominion and to report on scientific<br>
development generally. Many problems encountered by Indian scientists<br>
are similar to those Australians have experienced, and it is believed<br>
that the exchange of views and closer contacts between Indians and<br>
Australians resulting from a visit should prove of mutual benefit to<br>
both countries.<br>

EXPORTS-NEW RECORD.<br>
On 28th January, 1948, Mr. Pollard said-<br>
"" Australia's exports for the year ending 30th June, 1948, are<br>
expected to total œ 390,000,000, compared with œ 308,000,000 for 194647<br>
-an increase of 27 per cent. and an increase of 182 per cent. on the<br>
average figures for the five pre-war years ended 1938-39. Details are--<br>
WHEAT.-Estimated value of wheat and flour exports is œ 90,000,000, compared<br>
with œ 28,900,000 for 1946-47 and an average of œ 19,900,000 for the five<br>
p re-war years. Total volume of exports in terms of wheat may be less than<br>
10,000,000 bushels, compared with an average of 107,500,000 bushels in the five<br>
years ended 1938-39. The great increase in estimated value is due to the<br>
average export price being nearly five times pre-war level. </p>
<p>WooL.-Exports are expected to be worth œ 133,000,000, compared with<br>
œ 126,800,000 in 1946-47, in which year considerable shipments were made from<br>
stocks accumulated during the war. The estimated 35d. a lb. greasy basis<br>
compares with the 1946-47 return of 23d. a lb. and for the five pre-war years<br>
of 131d. a lb.<br>
BUTTER.-With a probable value of œ 16,700,000. shipments, which should<br>
reach a total of 70,000 tons, should be worth about 60 per cent. more than in<br>
either the previous period or the five pre-war years. when they were valued at<br>
about œ 10,400,000. If shipments did reach 70,000 tons in 1947-48 they would<br>
be about 26,000 less than the pre-war average but more than 10,000 tons above<br>
the 1946-47 total. An important factor in the decline in butter exports since<br>
pre-war is the diversion of more milk to whole milk consumption and production<br>
of processed milk.<br>
FROZEN MEATs.-Total exports are expected to increase from a verage of<br>
œ 9,100,000 in the five years ended 1938-39 and œ 10,500,000 in 1946-47 to<br>
œ 13,500,000 in the current period. Beef and veal shipments, estimated to total<br>
90,000 tons, will be nearly 10,000 tons more than in the previous period, but<br>
about 17 per cent. lower than before the war, when they averaged 106,000<br>
tons. Mutton and lamb. estimated at 70,000 tons, will he about 15 per cent.<br>
below the pre-war average of nearly 86.000 tons. The increased value of meat<br>
exports is due to an increase of about 90 per cent. in export prices.<br>
CHEESE.-Average shipments in the five pre-war years were 9,540 tons,<br>
worth œ 63 16s. a ton. For the current period, cheese exports are expected to<br>
reach 24,000 tons. at an estimated average price of œ 120 2s. a ton, the estimated<br>
total value for the season being nearly œ 2,900,000.<br>
EGGS.-For tile five pre-war years. shipments of eggs in shell averaged<br>
15,400,000 dozen valued at 13.52d. a dozen and eggs not in shell averaged 505,000<br>
lb. worth 7.9d. a lb. Estimated shipments to Britain for the current season are<br>
21,000,000 dozen eggs in shell at 2s. Id. a dozen, 20,000,000 lb. egg pulp at<br>
Is. 61d. a lb., and 2,000.000 11. egg pulp at 4s. lljd. a lb. New Zealand is<br>
expected to take 3,500.000 lb. egg pulp at ls. 7d. a lb. Total value of egg<br>
exports is estimated at almost œ 4,800.000.<br>
DRIED FRUITs.-Because of bad seasonal conditions, dried vine fruits' exports<br>
are expected to be below pre-war average in volume but higher in value.<br>
Current period's shipments are estimated at 45.000 tons worth œ 2,800,000, compared<br>
to pre-war average of 58,245 tons worth œ 2,200,000.<br>

WAR WITH JAPAN.<br>
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OCCUPATION FORCEADMINISTRATION.<br>
On 31st December, 1947, the acting Minister for Defence ( Mr.<br>
Drakeford) said that the British Commonwealth Governments whose<br>
troops were taking part in the occupation in Japan recently reviewed<br>
the system for the control and administration of the British Commonwealth<br>
Occupation Force. They had decided to modify the organization<br>
for combined control by the governments concerned.<br>
It had been agreed, subject to the continued retention by the participating<br>
governments of sovereign control of their own policy and full<br>
consultation when their interests were affected, that responsibility for<br>
the control and administration of the force would be assigned to the Australian<br>
Government to be exercised through the Department of Defence<br>
in relation to joint-service matters and through the Departments of the<br>
Navy, the Army and Air in regard to matters within their respective<br>
spheres. </p>
<p>The new system would be introduced in January, 1948. The Joint<br>
Chiefs of Staff Committee in Australia, which had planned for and<br>
controlled the force on behalf of the British Commonwealth Governments,<br>
would be dissolved when the new system was introdn~ Ai.<br>

URANIUM.<br>
On 12th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Under the Atomic Energy ( Control of Minerals) Act, the Commonwealth<br>
Government took power in 1946 to control production and<br>
distribution of uranium, thorium, plutonium, or any of their respective<br>
compounds or other substances which may be used for the -production<br>
of atomic energy.<br>
Following discussions in 1947 with the State Departments of<br>
Mines, a programme of investigation of resources of radio-active<br>
minerals has been carried out in Australia. The more important<br>
localities of investigation are the beach sands of the east coast of Australia<br>
( thorium), the Mount Fainter and Radium Hill areas of South<br>
Australia ( uranium), and the Port Hedland area of Western Australia<br>
( uranium and thorium).<br>
Cabinet decided to-day that the following rewards be approved in<br>
connexion with the discovery of uranium ore.-<br>
A reward of œ 1,000 for the discovery of any new deposit of uranium ore<br>
which, in the opinion of the Minister, is of economic significance. A new deposit<br>
to be defined as a deposit more than 15 miles from any known occurrence.<br>
A reward of a further œ 2,000 for discoveries which, in the opinion of the<br>
Minister, are capable -of producing 25 tons of uranium oxide, and a pro rata<br>
payment for any additional quantities in excess of 25 tons of uranium oxide.<br>
730-3 </p>
<p>"" 1The Minister will reserve the right to make payments of amounts<br>
to be determined by him to discoverers of new deposits which, although<br>
themselves not capable of yielding any substantial quantity of uraniumn<br>
oxide, may lead to the discovery of other deposits of importance.""<br>

LEAD-CONTROL.<br>
On 12th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The supply position of lead is very difficult in Britain and lead<br>
exported by Australia takes the place of that which would have to be<br>
procured by Britain from Canada and Mexico, involving the expenditure<br>
of dollars. The matter was dealt with by Cabinet in July, 1947y;<br>
but the Minister for ' Supply ( Senator Ashley) informed Cabinet to-day<br>
that there was evidence of dealers continuing to hold scrap lead.<br>
Cabinet decided that a further census of scrap lead be taken and<br>
dealers be required to, furnish details of their holdings at quarterly<br>
intervals thereafter. Export licences will be granted in respect of<br>
per cent. of declared holdings provided that holders furnish satisfactory<br>
evidence that the balance, including 50 per cent, of antimonial lead,<br>
has been sold for consumption in Australia. It is estimated that<br>
accumulated stocks of scrap lead in Australia amount to about 8,000<br>
tons, which could be turned to considerable advantage in the present<br>
dollar crisis."" MIGRATION.<br>
GOVERNMENT POLICY-TRANSPORT BY AIR.<br>
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
Cabinet to-day approved of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr.<br>
Calwell) approaching the British Government to ascertain its views<br>
regarding the transport of British migrants to Australia by air. After<br>
full investigation the matter will be again submitted to Cabinet for<br>
final consideration SHIP BUILDING.<br>
PROGRAMME-FURTHER REVISION.<br>
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
Cabinet approved to-day of the construction of four additional<br>
class motor vessels to be propelled by the Doxford type diesel<br>
engine-making a total of twelve of this class of vessel ( six diesel and<br>
six steam) in the Australian shipbuilding programme. Cabinet also<br>
approved of the construction of four C class vessels, two of which<br>
will be propelled by double-compound reciprocating marine engines and<br>
two by N-E type marine engines </p>
<p>CIVIL DEFENCE.<br>
BOMBING-COMMITTEE APPOINTED.<br>
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
In October 1947, confidential documents were received by the<br>
Minister for Works ( Mr. Lemmon) from the British Ministry of Works<br>
giving an analysis of damage caused by bombs, including the flying<br>
bomb and rocket projectiles, and of the effect of atomic bombs.<br>
Cabinet decided to-day that a Cabinet sub-committee comprising<br>
the Minister for Defence ( Mr. Dedman), the Postmaster-General<br>
( Senator Cameron), the Minister for the Interior ( Mr. Johnson), the<br>
Minister for Works ( Mr. Lemmon) and. myself be appointed to arrange<br>
for a group of senior officers with specialized knowledge to be appointed<br>
from appropriate departments to advise the Cabinet sub-committee"".<br>
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.<br>
FIRST NAVAL MEMBER.<br>
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" In August, 1944, War Cabinet decided that, on the completion of<br>
the term of appointment of Admiral -Sir Louis Hamilton as First Naval<br>
Member, an officer of the Royal Australia * n Navy should be appointed as<br>
First Naval Member and Chief of the Naval Staff.<br>
Cabinet decided to-day that Rear-Admiral J. A. Collins be<br>
appointed as First Naval Member and Chief of the Naval Staff. Rear-<br>
Admiral Collins has just completed an Imperial Defence College course<br>

SOUTH-EAST ASIA.<br>
SCHOLARSHIPS.<br>
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
Cabinet decided to-night that provision be made for the establishment<br>
of three Australian scholarships for students from South-east<br>
Asian countries. The scholarships will be founded by the Commonwealth<br>
Government at Australian universities; the approximate annual<br>
cost being estimated at œ 5,000. It was considered that the provisions of<br>
opportunities in Australia for the students concerned would give further<br>
practical evidence of the goodwill of the Australian people towards the<br>
peoples of the countries concerned, such as India, Pakistan, Burma,<br>
Malaya, Ceylon, -Siam, Philippines and Indonesia. Arrangements for<br>
the selection of scholars and their welfare in Australia will be worked<br>
out by the Department of External Affairs and Post-war Reconstruction<br>
in co-operation with consular or diplomatic representatives </p>
<p>RECONSTRUCTION.<br>
BRETTON WOODS AGREEMENT-INTERNATIONAL<br>
MONETARY FUND AND BANK DIRECTOR.<br>
On 13th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" Australia is eligible to participate in an election for the fourteenth<br>
Director of the International Monetary Fund and International Bank<br>
respectively. It is proposed to nominate the Secretary to the Treasury<br>
( Mr. S. G. McFarlane) for the executive directorship of both organizations.<br>
It is intended that the Commonwealth Statistician ( Dr. R.<br>
Wilson) will be the alternate director should Mr. McFarlane be elected.<br>
The tenure of office will be until September, 1948<br>
( Mr. McFarlane was later elected unopposed.)<br>
GOVERNMENT'S PLANS-SECONDARY INDUSTRY,<br>
DIVISION OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.<br>
On 21st January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
"" The Chairman of the Secondary Industries Commission ( Mr.<br>
J. K. Jensen) has discussed with me the position of manufacturing<br>
industries in Australia, having particular regard to their greatly<br>
increased importance relative to the Australian economy as a whole and<br>
to the fact that the condition of full employment now being experienced<br>
will tend to reduce the tempo at which sound expansion of manufacture<br>
can take place in the near future. We have also discussed the danger<br>
inherent in the present situation that some ventures may be started<br>
which are likely to be short-lived.<br>
The Australian manufacturing industry to-day gives employment<br>
to nearly 30 per cent. of the Australian labour force. Its growth,<br>
through the diversification of production, material assets and employment<br>
opportunities, has given added strength and resiliency to the<br>
whole economy.<br>
"" In framing financial and general economic policy, governments<br>
and public authorities generally must ensure that the manufacturing<br>
industries continue to be given, within the limits of our resources, every<br>
opportunity to flourish and to develop, so that in turn they may continue<br>
to make their maximum contribution to the national policy of full<br>
employment. To this end, Mr. Jensen has represented to me that as<br>
much information as possible should be collated and made public regarding<br>
the structure and operation of manufacturing industry. Such<br>
information should be of use to management and entrepreneurs who<br>
are directly responsible for the operation of established ventures and<br>
the launching of new ones.<br>
The statistical information currently available aims only at giving<br>
a broad picture of the structure of industry. While it presents invaluable<br>
information, it is evident that additional data are desirable in<br>
, order to appreciate the position at any particular time of any one industry.<br>
For the guidance both of public authorities and of private interest, </p>
<p>therefore, we must aimu where possible to improve the information-which<br>
can be made available, whether it be from current statistics or from the<br>
results of special surveys. Sometimes such additional information is<br>
of a kind that cannot be reduced to statistical presentation. The sort<br>
of information which I have in mind includes particulars about existing<br>
and projected productive capacity; the demand for products; the age<br>
and relative efficiency of machinery and plants.<br>
As a result of the willing co-operation of industrialists with which<br>
it has been associated, the Division of Industrial Development has<br>
accumulated much information about manufacturing in Australia.<br>
I have arranged that this division, drawing on its own resources and<br>
the resources of other government departments associated in this field,<br>
should prepare for public information periodical reviews, bringing<br>
together all the relevant information that can be obtained about as<br>
many manufacturing industries as possible.<br>
In preparing these reviews no attempt will be made by the division<br>
to ask manufacturers to give any additional information regarding<br>
their operations unless the manufacturers themselves find it expedient<br>
to do so FIFTH SECURITY LOAN.<br>
TERMS ANNOUNCED.<br>
On 13th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The long-term interest rate on bonds and inscribed stock issued for<br>
the next loan to be raised by the Commonwealth Government will be<br>
maintained at œ 3 2s. 6d. per cent. The same rate applied to the<br>
successful Third and Fourth Security Loans floated in 1947. The<br>
securities to be issued will be for a period of approximately twelve<br>
years. Once again there will be no short-term securities.""<br>
On 4th February, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The next Commonwealth cash loan will open on 14th April, 194S.<br>
The amount to be sought for repatriation, rehabilitation and public<br>
works of the Commonwealth and States will be œ 35,000,000. The loan<br>
will be raised under the title of Fifth Security Loan.<br>
The loan campaign will close on 5th May, 1948, but the Treasurer<br>
reserves the right to close the loan at any earlier time if he should<br>
consider that course desirable.""<br>
WHEAT STABILIZATION PLAN SCHEME.<br>
POST-WAR-CONTINUANCE, MI-NISTER'S<br>
ANNOUNCEMENT.<br>
On 15th January, 1948, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture<br>
( Mr. Pollard) announced that from 19th January, 1948, and to<br>
the conclusion of the marketing of the 1951-52 wheat crop a price of<br>
6s. 3d. a bushel bulk f. o. r. ports would apply for all wheat sold by the </p>
<p>Australian Wheat Board for human consumption and stock feed within<br>
Australia. The Commonwealth Government would guarantee a price of<br>
6s. 3d. a bushel bulk f. o. r. ports for all wheat sold by the Australian<br>
Wheat Board for consumption within Australia and for all wheat<br>
exported. The guaranteed price would be dependent on the States<br>
passing legislation identical with that required as complementary to<br>
the Wheat Stabilization Act of 1946 except in respect to the essential<br>
price alteration necessary to that Act to guarantee 6s. 3d. a bushel bulk<br>
f. o. r. ports. State complementary legislation would have to operate for<br>
the 1948-49 crop.<br>
In the event of the Cost of Inquiry Committee recommending an<br>
index accepted as practicable by the Commonwealth Government, consideration<br>
would be given to varying the price up or down according to<br>
the index variation.<br>
The operation of the plan would continue with the following alterations-<br>
the contribution of 50 per cent. would start under the new plan<br>
at 6s. 3d. a bushel bulk instead of 5s. 3d. a bushel bagged. The ceiling<br>
at which contributions stopped would be 10s. 7d. a bushel bulk instead<br>
of 9s. 6d. a bushel bagged.<br>
Stabilization contributions already collected on the 1945-46 crop<br>
would be distributed to growers not later than December, 1948, in proportion<br>
to their deliveries to the board -but no further distributious<br>
from the fund would be made except as Cabinet approved in the light of<br>
the position at the time. After disbursal of the 1945-46 contributions,<br>
œ 20,000,000 would be regarded as a reasonable minimum for the fund.<br>
The scheme would be reviewed -before the end of the 1951-52 season.<br>
The decisions followed the presentation on 18th December, 1947, of<br>
an interim report by the Cost of Inquiry Committee. The committee<br>
found a cost figure of 6s. a bushel at sidings. Conversion of that price<br>
to a bulk f. o. r. basis indicated a price of 6s. 8d. a bushel. Having<br>
regard to the long-range security provided and the profitable return to<br>
a reasonably efficient producer, the Government adopted 6s. 3d. a bushcl<br>
bulk f. o. r. ports as a fair proposition to all concerned including consumers<br>
and stock feeders. The price represented an increase of about<br>
is. 4d. a ' bushel bulk f. o. r. ports for home consumption purposes and<br>
Is. 3d. a bushel in the overall guaranteed price. With a refund to<br>
growers of about is. 1.5d. the 1945-46 fund contribution for that year's<br>
crop would return them 7s. 4.5d. a bushel bulk ( less freight). It was estimated<br>
that final returns for the 1946-47 crop would amount to 7s. 9d.<br>
a bushel bulk ( less freight).<br>
The crop now being harvested would give a price return substan-.<br>
tially in excess of the 1945-46 and 1946-47 crops. The plan in its<br>
revised form, if accepted by the States and growers, would give effective<br>
security for four crops after the one now being harvested. In the<br>
absence of Commonwealth marketing powers, complementary legislation<br>
by the States was essential.<br>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION.<br>
DIRECT OR-GENERAL.<br>
On 15th January, 1948, the Minister for Information ( Mr.<br>
, Calwell) announced that the Director-General of Information ( Mr.<br>

CONVERSION LOAN.<br>
LONDON OPERATION, JANUARY, 1948.<br>
On 22nd January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" A conversion loan is being floated at London to convert a New<br>
South Wales loan of œ 17,870,000, bearing interest at 51 per cent. per<br>
annum, over which an option of conversion is held by the Government.<br>
The terms of the new loan are: Issue price 984, interest rate 3<br>
per cent, per annum, maturity date 1st May, 1965, with the option to the<br>
Government of prior redemption on or after 1st May, 1963.<br>
Conversion offer will be made to all existing holders of the old<br>
loan but issue of new stock will be limited to œ 12,870,000, as œ 5,000,000<br>
of old stock is being redeemed. The new loan will result in a substantial<br>
saving of interest to the New South Wales Government.""<br>
BURMA.<br>
BURMESE DELEGATION.<br>
On 27th January, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br>
Evatt) said that a delegation of Burmese Government officials would<br>
arrive in Australia on 28th January, 1948. The delegation comprised<br>
the Chairman of the Burmese Public Service Commission ( Thakin Lun<br>
Baw), Boh Toon Lin and Lee Boon Thi. They would have consultations<br>
with the Commonwealth Public Service Board on public service<br>
organization and administration. NATIONAL GALLERY.<br>
On 4th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" Mr. G. W. Booth, of Melbourne, has presented to the Commonwealth<br>
Government, for inclusion in the National Collection of Art<br>
Treasuires, a very fine painting by the late Tom Roberts.""<br>
FOURTH SECURITY LOAN.<br>
OVER-SUBSCRIPTION.<br>
Cash subscriptions to the Fourth Security Loan of œ 48,000,000<br>
totalled œ 61,155,000 and œ 17,392,000 of the œ 32,000,000 conversion<br>
loan were converted.<br>

RECONSTRUCTION.<br>
TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT-AGREEMENT.<br>
In Parlilament.-On llth November, 1947, the Minister for Post-war<br>
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) said-<br>
The recent Geneva negotiations are the latest phase of the programme<br>
of international economic collaboration first foreshadowed in<br>
the Atlantic Charter, and subsequently developed in Lend-lease, the<br>
Mutual Aid Agreement, Unrra, the Food and Agricultural Organization,<br>
the two Bretton Woods institutions and the economic machinery of the<br>
I 1 </p>
<p>United Nations. They originated in an invitation issued by the United<br>
States Government in 1945 to fourteen other important trading countries<br>
to participate in two simultaneous sets of preliminary negotiations.<br>
One of these was designed to draw up a draft charter, incorporating<br>
rules to govern the future conduct of international trade, for submission<br>
to a world conference on trade and employment with a view to establishing<br>
an International Trade Organization. The other negotiations<br>
were to give practical effect to the policy of expanding international<br>
trade by bringing about a series of mutually advantageous trade agreements.<br>
After the establishment of the United Nations organization, the<br>
proposed charter negotiations were brought under United Nations<br>
auspices by the acceptance of a resolution proposed by the United<br>
States at the first meeting of the Economic and Social Council in<br>
February, 1946. The council established a preparatory committee to<br>
elaborate an annotated draft agenda for the consideration of a world<br>
conference on trade and employment. Throughout the planning of the<br>
United Nations economic machinery, it had been assumed that a<br>
specialized agency would eventually be established to deal with international<br>
trade-the most immediately important of all international<br>
economic problems. The Economic and Social Council added three more<br>
countries to those originally invited. They are-<br>
United Kingdom, United States of America, the Union of Socialist Soviet<br>
Republics, France. Belgium-Luxembourg. Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Norway,<br>
Lebanon. Canada. India. South Africa. New Zealand. Australia. China. Cuba,<br>
Brazil and Chile.<br>
The Union of Socialist Soviet Republics has not yet participated.<br>
The first section of the Preparatory Committee thus set up was held<br>
at London in October and November, 1946, and was preceded by an<br>
exchange of views between British Commonwealth countries. This first<br>
session had before it a set of draft proposals for an International Trade<br>
Organization published by the United States Government in 1945, and<br>
supported by the British Government, which had publicly expressed its<br>
agreement on all important points. It had also to consider a more<br>
elaborate draft charter subsequently published by the United States<br>
Government on its own initiative. As a matter of convenience, and<br>
largely because it was more detailed, the Preparatory Committee decided<br>
to adopt the latter draft, together with less comprehensive proposals put<br>
forward by other delegations as the ' basis for discussion.<br>
The United States draft proposals were very substantially modified<br>
in the course of discussion, and new sections were added, but time prevented<br>
more than a hasty exchange of views on some significant questions.<br>
The rough text of a possible trade charter was drawn up and<br>
included in the first report of the Preparatory Committee to the<br>
Economic and Social Council. A drafting committee was appointed to<br>
examine this text in detail, and to recommend drafting changes. The<br>
drafting committee met at New York in February and March, 1947,<br>
and the resulting text became the basis for the second and final session<br>
of the Preparatory Committee at Geneva which recently concluded. I </p>
<p>propose to deal later with questions of the draft charter for the International<br>
Trade Organization, which will be the subject-matter of the<br>
coming World Trade and Employment Conference at Havana.<br>
Meanwhile, both for convenience and because the governments of<br>
a number of countries felt strongly that the two sets of negotiations<br>
were essentially interdependent, the first session of the Preparatory<br>
Committee recommended to the Economic and Social Council that the<br>
tariff negotiations for which the United States Government had issued<br>
invitations should also be brought under United Nations auspices. As a<br>
result, tariff negotiations began at Geneva on 10th August, 1947, about<br>
a month before the resumption of the charter discussions. Both tariff<br>
and charter negotiations were preceded by British Commonwealth discussions.<br>
The pre-tariff talks at London in March, 1947, dealt largely<br>
with the likely repercussions of the tariff negotiations on imperial<br>
preference, ' but those on the charter at Geneva covered the issues in<br>
rather more general terms.<br>
The tariff negotiations have been quite distinct from the charter<br>
discussions, and the aim has been to bring the results into effect without<br>
necessarily waiting for the establishment of the International Trade<br>
Organization. The results have been incorporated in a Draft General<br>
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for the consideration of governments,<br>
which will be published on 18th November, 1947, and which the Government<br>
ha. s decided to apply provisionally from that date. Until it is<br>
published it is impossible to deal with the negotiations except in general<br>
terms. The governments of all countries, members of the Preparatory<br>
Committee, are invited to become parties to the agreement. This<br>
generalization will extend the scope of the benefits to be received, and<br>
as a result Australia will obtain the benefit of the reductions negotiated<br>
among the other sixteen countries in addition to those negotiated by<br>
itself. Some of the former reductions are of little benefit, : but others<br>
will provide worthwhile benefits. In some countries these indirect benefits<br>
are considerable, and, taken on the aggregate, they represent a<br>
general extension of export opportunities for Australia. The agreement<br>
is in three parts. Part I. contains-<br>
The schedules of tariff reduction whici have beer, negotiated by all the<br>
countries concerned.<br>
An undertaking to extend imost-faiured-inatior treatment to other parties<br>
except for existing preferences which are formally recognized as valid to the<br>
extent that they have not been altered in the current negotiations.<br>
Part II. contains undertakings regarding commercial policy. These<br>
are necessary primarily to prevent tariff concessions granted being offset<br>
by other protective measures and follow closely chapter IV. of the<br>
draft charter. In practice they involve no significant change in Australian<br>
commercial policy. In particular they preserve-<br>
The right to impose new duties or protective purposes except where we<br>
specifically have accepted. or niny accept. as binding in tariff negotiations.<br>
The right to impose import restrictions to protet our balance rf payments. </p>

Part 111. contains mainly machinery provisions.<br>
If finally ratified, the agreement will run for three years but will<br>
continue thereafter unless it is specifically terminated. Special provisions<br>
protect our right to withdraw particular items which, in changed<br>
circumstances, we may wish to protect further without terminating the<br>
whole agreement.<br>
If changes are made in the draft charter at the Havana Conference,<br>
it is proposed that relevant parts of the agreement would be amended<br>
accordingly unless the parties to the agreement decide otherwise, and<br>
consequently countries applying the agreement provisionally are<br>
expected to carry out Part II. only to the extent permitted by existing<br>
legislation. The negotiations have been conducted against an economic backgroundi<br>
dominated by the slow recovery of war-devastated countries, and<br>
by the world-wide shortage of dollars. United States' exports in 1945<br>
aind 1946 totalled 26,000,000,000 dollars, compared with imports of<br>
9.000,000,000 dollars. For 1947 the figures up to 31st July were<br>
8.700,000,000 dollars and 3,300,000,000 dollars. There can be no world<br>
economic stability until the United States spends abroad on direct purchases<br>
of imports a greater proportion of her international income.<br>
The results of the negotiations as a whole must, therefore, be judged<br>
primarily hy their effect on the trade relationship between the United<br>
States and tle rest of the world. While it is easy to exaggerate the effect<br>
of tariff reduction, it is clear that a serious endeavour has been made t<br>
open the United States' market to imports. The effect of this should be<br>
apparent as soon as producion in countries other than the United Stat: e<br>
reaches levels capable of taking advantage of the changes.<br>
On the other hand, the agreement permits the maintenance of<br>
quantitative restrictions for balance of payments reasons and until<br>
dollars. ire available also permits discrimination against United State.-<br>
goods. So long ns the present international payments difficulties being<br>
experienced by practically all countries except United States persi: t.<br>
the United States cannot expect to benefit fully from concession. s<br>
granted to it. The agreement as a whole, therefore, should be a significant<br>
contribution to a restoration of a more reasonable balance between<br>
dollar and non-dollar payments.<br>
Britain hopes to improve its direct dollar earning. by increased<br>
exports to United States and indirectly by concessions granted by tbhe<br>
United Sta'es to other countries. Similarly, any stimulus to European<br>
recovery is of value to Britain. Any strengthening of Britain's position<br>
is. of course, of great value to Australia since it increases Britain's<br>
international purchasing power, on which we are very dependent. </p>
<p>I summarize briefly the direct and indirect benefits which may be<br>
expected to accrue as a result of the proposals arising from the Geneva<br>
negotiations if they are confirmed by the respective governments concerned.<br>
The tariff concessions affecting Australian exports take the<br>
form of actual reductions in existing rates of duty, or, where duty-frep<br>
entry or low duties already operate, the binding of such duty-free entry<br>
or low rates. In many items such binding is of material value because<br>
of ; he insurance it gives against increases in tariff rates which now<br>
tand at low levels. Tariff concessions have been offered to Australia on<br>
almost all the principal products which Australia exports or can expect<br>
to export, to the individual countries concerned. Generally, the offers<br>
have been made directly to Australia, but in some cases the benefits wiil<br>
arise indirectly from offers made to a third country which is a more<br>
important supplier of the particular product. The concessions should<br>
lie of real importance in relation to the future development of primary<br>
production in Australia. Further, they include items of importance to<br>
Australian secondary industry.<br>
Trade opportunities may also be expected to arise in respect of a<br>
number of products of export interest to Australia on which tariff con<br>
ccssions have been offered to other countries. Indirect benefits will al-o<br>
affect a wide range of manufactured products in which there is oppor<br>
tunity for expansion of Australian production and exports. The reductions<br>
of duties obtained in the course of the present negotiations are<br>
important, not only in themselves, but also by reason of the fact that<br>
they ensure a relatively advantageous starting point for futurein egotiations.<br>
This is specially important in the case of the United States.<br>
where a 50 per cent. reduction in duties is the imaximumn cut perminssible<br>
in any one agreement under the United States Reciprocal Trad-<br>
.\ greements Act. It is only by such negotiation. that high d; itie can<br>
hle progressively reduced to reasonably low level.<br>
To secure the above-mentioned benefits, Australia ha. s been obliged<br>
to offer some concessions. These have taken the form of concurrence<br>
in the reduction of certain preferences at present enjoyed in Empire<br>
countries and of ecneessiun in the Australian tariff. Both were<br>
unavoidable. We cannot expect to obtain the advantage of such negotiations<br>
without making some concessions ourselves. In assessing the outcome,<br>
it is essential to have regard to the likely effect on the Australian<br>
economy. We have not concurred in any proposed reductions in preferential<br>
margins except where such concessions are considered to be<br>
within the capacity of the Australian industries affected and where<br>
-alti4factory compensation concessions have been offered in return. The<br>
other concession which Australia was required to make in return for tin<br>
benefits offered were in the protective tariff. Most of the concessions<br>
proposed are individually small but they cover a very wide field. The<br>
Government has every confidence in the ability of Australian industry<br>
to withstand the concessions. Prices levels in Australia have risen </p>
<p>much less than in most overseas countries. This has resulted in Au. iiralian<br>
industries enjoying greater competitive advantages and an<br>
ability to compete within the shelter of a lower tariff wall than that<br>
provided by the present Customs Tariff.<br>
If the draft general agreement is eventually adopted by Australia it<br>
is not likely to result in any substantial increase in imports into<br>
Australia in competition with Australian production, and, where such<br>
increase does occur, it is likely to be absorbed by greater demand and<br>
consequently not affect Australian industry. The lower duties on goods<br>
which are imported will tend to reduce prices, and this, together with<br>
any increased supplies of goods, will be a useful offset to inflationary<br>
tendencies in the economy. The narrowing of the margins of preference<br>
at present enjoyed by Britain, Canada and New Zealand on a number of<br>
items may affect to some extent the advantage which these countries<br>
had had in the Australian market, but in no case has a contractual<br>
margin of preference been reduced except with the consent of the country<br>
enjoying preference rights under the Australian Customs Tariff.<br>
It is to the outcome of our negotiations with the United States<br>
that the Government attaches paramount importance. This market,<br>
whatever its vicissitudes, is by far the world's greatest. It matches an<br>
industrial output which is at least equal to that of the rest of the entire<br>
world. Even since the outbreak of World War II. the population of the<br>
United States has increased by almost double the total population of<br>
Australia. At the same time rising living standards and soaring<br>
incomes have greatly increased average purchasing power per head.<br>
It is a country where agricultural costs, despite increasing efficiency,<br>
steadily outpace those of other countries. At the prices at which we<br>
could afford to supply, the American public would buy a , very much<br>
larger quantity of foodstuffs. But in recent years exorbitant tariffs<br>
have barred the way to meeting this demand.<br>
"" A significant section of Australian industry is geared to dollar<br>
imports, without which, as we are finding now, our industrial capacity<br>
is handicapped. Further development in the future will require much<br>
greater supplies of dollars for the purchase of equipment and essential<br>
supplies. Not only Australia, but also the whole sterling area is starved<br>
for dollars. The only way to increase the supply permanently is to<br>
increase exports to the United States. Any increase in our earnings<br>
would benefit not only us but also nearly all our best customers. It<br>
would help to redress the world balance against the dollar. The<br>
cardinal point of our policy throughout the negotiations has been to<br>
break down this great barrier to the further expansion of Australia's<br>
greatest primary industries. Throughout the inter-war period market<br>
factors, not technical, inhibited their growth. Wool, beef, butter and<br>
lamb were all held back by the closure of the American market not<br>
only to our produce but also to that of our competitors. When one<br>
looks beyond the immediate dislocation and exceptional circumstances<br>
of to-day, to the market prospects of coming years, two factors stand<br>
out-shrinking markets in western Europe, including Britain, </p>
<p>and a growing one in the United States. The population of western<br>
Europe is likely to start declining within a few years accompanied<br>
probably by stationary if not falling income per capita. To make<br>
matters worse, Britain, our main market for foodstuffs, is embarking<br>
on policies of increasing self-sufficiency. This will in turn increase<br>
its production costs and weaken its competitive power still further, thus<br>
lessening its international purchasing power upon which we have<br>
depended so heavily in the past. Dislocation in Asia, too, is likely to<br>
reduce the flow and increase the price of many of the foodstuffs and<br>
raw materials needed to sustain the industry and purchasing power of<br>
western Europe.<br>
Very different trends are manifest in America. So convinced has<br>
the Government been of the necessity to break down the barriers to all<br>
exports to the United States, not only of foodstuffs, that for a while,<br>
as became well known, we risked a breakdown of the whole of the<br>
Geneva negotiations in the period immediately preceding the veto by<br>
President Truman of the United States Congress bill to increase wool<br>
duties. In short, if the draft agreement is accepted by the governments<br>
concerned, it should make a significant contribution to a solution of the<br>
problems created by the world-wide shortage of dollars. It should<br>
materially assist Britain in its economic difficulties and thus help to<br>
maintain its international purchasing power, and above all it holds out<br>
the prospect of greatly increasing our earnings of foreign exchange by<br>
extending the range of our export opportunities, especially in the<br>
United States, thus paving the way for the further expansion and<br>
development of Australian primary and secondary industries.<br>
Although our negotiations with the United States of America<br>
overshadow the rest, the latter are in the aggregate of considerable<br>
significance. We conducted negotiations with seventeen different countries,<br>
including Britain, in relationship to which we are in a very<br>
special position. The outcome of these negotiations will become<br>
apparent when the general agreemen: on tariffs and trade is published<br>
on 18th November. If and uhen the general agreement is accepted by<br>
the requisite number of parties, an Interim Tariff Committee will be<br>
established on which each accepting country will be represented on a<br>
basis of equality. In due course, it is hoped that other countries will<br>
negotiate sufficient tariff reductions to satisfy existing members and<br>
thus qualify for membership of the Interim Tariff Committee. The<br>
treatment to be accorded to non-members is still unresolved, but it is<br>
likely to be as favorable as that extended to members at least until<br>
they have had sufficient time to negotiate appropriate reductions and<br>
have failed to do so. Eventually, if the International Trade Organization<br>
is set up and the most important trading countries become n embers<br>
of both the International Trade Organization and the Interim Tariff<br>
Committee, the latter will be dissolved and its functions and membership<br>
transferred to a tariff committee within the International Trade<br>
Organization. Thereafter the Tariff Committee will be the competent<br>
body for the conduct of all International Trade Organization activities<br>
in regard to tariffs. </p>

The drcaft charter msq necessarily be assessedh to a coiisiderale<br>
degree in terms of its applicability to culrrent economic conditions. It<br>
was conceived originally, not as an interim instrument to meet the<br>
immiediate problems of : he post-war transition period, but as A qvt of<br>
guiding principles to governi thme conduct of international trade onl a<br>
multilateral basis once normality had been restored. It isq clear 1now<br>
that the scale of dislocation and the time necessary for recovery we<br>
gravely underestimated. Relief and( recon-struction rather than eompetitive<br>
intfernationaql trade are like to Ile -the magin object of international<br>
attention in thle economic field for some time to come.<br>
"" The outstanding problems at pres ent revolve round -the deterioration<br>
in Britain's trading position, formerly the pivot of international<br>
trtide: the relapc~ of Fiurope after tile beginning of recovery, and( the </p>
<p>11<br>
cverance of ; he surplus food-producing capacity of the East from the<br>
more industrialized West; and devastation and dislocation in Asia.<br>
' ntil production and the supply of basic essentials in these areas can be<br>
restored, they will be vitally dependent on North America, the only<br>
area capable of dealing with the situation on the scale required, and<br>
will be quite incapable of producing the surplus a ove e-sential needs<br>
necessary to pay for the aid required. Thus, despite Unrra, the United<br>
States loan to Britain and the other direct and indirect aid already<br>
furnished by the United Statei on a huge scale, the shortage of dollars<br>
persists. The United States is now the dominating force in international<br>
trade, and while the demand for dollars so greatly exceeds tile supply,<br>
disequilibrium in the payments position of other countries is likely io<br>
continue. A reasonable measure of equilibrium in the balance ot<br>
', aymnents of the main trading nations without widespread resort to<br>
restriction however, a basic condition for the full application of the<br>
ultimate International Trade Organization scheme.<br>
Despite many obstacles, the projected organization could assist<br>
rehabilitation considerably. In the first place, it would provide a<br>
forum for the consideration of common problems in a conciliatory<br>
spirit by acquainting the governments and their official advisers with<br>
the problems of others which in sum are likely to add up to those of<br>
rie trading world. The value of this understanding, often so grievously<br>
lacking in the past, should not be under-rated. The will and practise<br>
of co-operation between members in solving trading problems would,<br>
in any case, be much more important than the governing rules, many<br>
of lwhich are difficult to define in ways applicable to ail likely circumranees.<br>
. Actually, the exceptions written into the charter are sufficient<br>
to cover any measures likely to be necessary, even in the immediate<br>
future. There is nothing to prevent the projected International Trade<br>
Organization making a substantial and effective contribution to current<br>
world problems from the moment it is established.<br>
"" Secondly, the main principles of the International Trade<br>
Organization charter, even if impossible of rigid applications now, are<br>
a beacon for the future. They uphold multilateral trade as a desirable<br>
goal, as soon as conditions permit. This aiming point should incline<br>
members towards an integral system, away from the exclusive trading<br>
blocs which have proved so politically and economically expensive in<br>
the past.<br>
"" Thirdly, in conjunction with the tariff reduction programme, it<br>
would help to restore the balance of the re. st of the world with the dollar<br>
area, by weakening restrictions on imports into the United States,<br>
while permitting other countries to ration available dollars in accordance<br>
with their needs, until they can earn enough to dispense with such<br>
in pediments to expansion. A careful scrutiny of the charter will<br>
reveal that the only really important trading country which will be<br>
subject to all the restraints which it imposes on the conduct of commercial<br>
policy for a long time to come is the United States. That<br>
rountry will he extending negotiated tariff reductions to others which I </p>
<p>have been granted in exchange for concessions by other countries which<br>
they, in many cases, will be unable to reciprocate. Balance of payments<br>
restrictions, imposed within the provisions of the charter, will<br>
prevent their extending many concessions made to the United States,<br>
virtually until the present widespread dollar difficulties have been<br>
overcome. Nearly all other members of the International Trade<br>
Organization would be able to apply measures forbidden to the United<br>
States because of its uniquely favorable position. Apart from temporary<br>
difficulties, the more permanent escape clauses, especially those<br>
designed in Chapter III. to facilitate industrial development in less<br>
advanced areas, are not ones that are likely to be open to the United<br>
States. Likewise, the measures envisaged by the charter in the event<br>
of a failure to maintain employment, or in cases when one country's<br>
payments position is causing widespread difficulties to others, all relate<br>
primarily to the United States. The fact that such a charter should<br>
be agreed upon by representatives of the United States reveals a<br>
realistic understanding of the problems of the rest of the world which<br>
is not only a far-sighted and enlightened gesture in this context, but<br>
also a most hopeful augury for the future of the projected organization.<br>
It is too soon to judge the likely effect of the charter on Australian<br>
interests. The final draft has yet to emerge from the Havana<br>
conference, and even then to be subsequently approved by the governments<br>
concerned. It will have to be examined eventually in conjunction<br>
with the overall programme which embraces the general<br>
agreement on tariffs and trade. Even at this stage, though the<br>
Government is in no way committed, it tay be appropriate to refer<br>
to a number of factors likely to be relevant later when deciding whether<br>
or not to join the International Trade Organization. I deal with a<br>
few questions of particular concern to Australia. First, there is the<br>
future of Imperial preference, which is, for us, a question of hard<br>
economic reality. The effect of article 16 of the draft charter is to<br>
ø preserve intact the existing British preferential system. There is no<br>
obligation anywhere in the draft charter to reduce or eliminate any<br>
margin of preference except by agreement of all the parties concerned.<br>
It is clearly envisaged that any such action will be taken only in return<br>
for equivalent tariff concessions by other countries as part of a mutually<br>
advantageous bargaining process. At the same time, no new preference<br>
may be created. Actually, no other British country has extended<br>
any new preference of importance to Australia for many years, and,<br>
in any case, the British Government is formally committed against<br>
such a course, while it is well known that Canada concurs in this<br>
attitude. British countries, and others already operating preference<br>
systems, may thus continue to enjoy differential trading advantage.
in each other's markets, and even barter them for tariff concessions,<br>
while only in very exceptional circumstances can other countries start<br>
new systems between themselves. The creation of mutual preferences<br>
by other countries which would discriminate against British trade, and<br>
thus arouse our resentment, just as the discrimination applied by us </p>
<p>arouses theirs, would be quite a likely development in the near future<br>
unless the draft charter comes into operation and prevents it. The<br>
attitude of the representatives of certain other countries at Geneva<br>
clearly revealed this possibility.<br>
In connexion with preference, the Government has borne constantly<br>
in mind the future of settlement in the northern parts of the continent,<br>
particularly Queensland which is dependent on the sugar industry.<br>
It will be noted that sugar is subject to an international agreement and<br>
consequently comes under the provisions of Chapter VI. Commodities;<br>
those of Chapter IV., Commercial Policy, do not apply. The important<br>
embargo and other devices used to protect sugar are not called into<br>
question by the draft charter. It is recognized generally that different<br>
considerations must be applied to the marketing of manufactured and<br>
primary products because of the essential differences in the economic<br>
factors which govern them.<br>
Another important instrument of Australian economic policy are<br>
the stabilization schemes for the marketing of primary products. In<br>
a number of cases, these depend on differential prices, prices between<br>
home and overseas sales and the periodic operation of subsidies in<br>
various forms. Without entering into a detailed explanation now, I<br>
point out that all our present schemes would be permitted under the<br>
terms of the draft charter.<br>
"" From the more general point of view, the existence of some<br>
international body to determine the lines on which international trade<br>
shall be conducted seems to offer considerable advantages to Australia.<br>
Such a body would almost inevitably increase the influence of small<br>
and medium-sized countries, giving them a voice in decisions and<br>
enabling them to play an important part in affairs from which they<br>
would otherwise tend to be excluded. Without it, important decisions<br>
would be made by the giants in concert and small countries would be<br>
grouped around and dominated by them. The embryonic International<br>
Trade Organization charter already bears considerable imprint of<br>
Australian ideas. Our delegation has been enabled to play a constructive<br>
part at every stage of the deliberations.<br>
From the economic stand-point, Australia is highly dependent on<br>
international trade. Only through this medium can many of our<br>
industries be kept working and the living standards of our people<br>
improved. Order rather than cut-throat chaos suits our purposes and<br>
our resources. Our interests lie especially along the lines of flexible<br>
multi-lateral trade. We need new markets to pay for the imports<br>
which our development requires. Our old markets are located mainly<br>
in Britain and Europe, the relative world economic importance of<br>
which is declining. The population of western Europe will begin to<br>
decline sharply within a few years and this will limit its need for our<br>
foodstuffs. Our main avenues of development, partictularly for the<br>
export of manufactured goods, point in new directions. It would be </p>
<p>foolish to allow old habits of thought to hide ail signposts to the future.<br>
In such a changing world, it may be important for us to be able to meet<br>
our future customers regularly round the conference table to dis.; use<br>
our reciprocal needs and wishes.<br>
We have a particularly strong interest in the maintenance of a<br>
high and stable demand for our export products. The employment<br>
provisions of the charter are an important psychological factor as well<br>
as an ' escape' clause. They underline the source of demand for<br>
exports and emphasize the bad neighbourliness of allowing preventable<br>
unemployment. The commodity' provisions of the charter should<br>
also assist in removing some of the instability from which we have<br>
suffered in the past.<br>
One of the main planks of Australian policy is industriilizatioll<br>
and full development of our resources. While the original International<br>
Trade Organization proposals might have resulted in certain<br>
aspects of this policy being called into question, the latest draft stresses<br>
the importance of such policies in ultimately furtheri worhl<br>
prosperity, subject of course, to reasonable safeguards. ' Th iImu<br>
trial development of other countries, especially those of wonul<br>
enlarge Australia's potential export market. Another inpral. i t interest<br>
of Australia is that of being able to protect our ec( uonv maT frll'<br>
as possible against the impact of adverse worll conditionls \\ iht. it r ernational<br>
measures fail, without incurring odillum elsewhere ) or provoking<br>
retaliation. This is provided for by the charter. ThIe International<br>
Trade Organization would provide for a forum for expressing<br>
our views and explaining our position in sucl circuimsita ices.<br>
For better or worse International Trade Organization is likely to , e<br>
the only attempt to establish an international body in the trade sphelre<br>
in this generation. If it is set up Australian interests will be markedly<br>
influenced whether we go in or stay out. The Government is also<br>
mindful of the implications of the International Trade Organization<br>
programnme in the wide political sphere. The economic strife which<br>
was both a product of and contributor towards the political rivalries<br>
which eventually led to the recent war could easily revive unless positive<br>
steps are taken to direct efforts along more enlightened channels.<br>
The recent tariff negotiations at Geneva, though still to be adopted by<br>
governments, do represent an example of international co-operation<br>
in a sphere very susceptible to conflict. This is heartening in itself<br>
at a time when so many aspects of international relations are unsatisfactory<br>
and disturbing. Economic distress easily erupts into the major<br>
poltical upheavals which eventually threaten the peace. The growth of<br>
international co-operation on a functional basis to deal with the<br>
practical problems facing the world is something which the Government<br>
believes should be most actively encouraged. It will continue to<br>
persevere in its efforts to secure the kind of International Trade<br>
Organization charter which would be a significant contribution both<br>
to material welfare and world peace."" </p>

WORLD ORGANIZATION-SOUTH PACIFIC COMMISSION,<br>
INTERIM ORGANIZATION.<br>
On 20th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said---<br>
At the South Seas conference at Canberra in February, 1947, six<br>
governments signed an agreement providing for the establishment of the<br>
South Pacific Commission. The agreement is to enter into force<br>
when it has been formally accepted by all governments. Acceptances<br>
have been effected by the Governments of New Zealand, Australia and<br>
Britain. Procedural diflicultiees have delayed the acceptances of the<br>
Governments of the United States, France and the Netherlands, but it<br>
i. s expected that These will be notified to the Australian Government<br>
within the nlear future.<br>
In the meantime, the Australian and New Zealand Governments<br>
have by agreement with the other four governments, established a South<br>
Pacific Commlission interim organization with head-quarters at . Sydney<br>
to make preliminary arrangements for the establishment of the commission.<br>
A meeting of representatives of all signatory governments will<br>
be held at Sydney in November, 1947. This meeting will examine the<br>
past and future work of the interim organization and, with a view to<br>
expediting discussions at the first formal meeting of the commission,<br>
which it is hoped will take place early in 1948, will discuss plans for the<br>
structure of the secretariat of the coilnnisicn and related matters.""<br>

<p>THE GOVERNMENT.<br>
POLICY-NATIONALIZATION.<br>
In Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br>
Chifley) said-<br>
"" Representations have been received from various trades unions<br>
regarding the nationalization of coal mines and the iron and steel<br>
industry, and in reply I have pointed out that the Commonwealth Parliament<br>
has no power under the Constitution to nationalize those industries,<br>
even if the Government wished to do so. Therefore, it is sheer<br>
nonsense to talk of the Government's plans for nationalizing suhi<br>
industries."" MINISTERS OF STATE-BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Partiament.-On 19th Novembei, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br>
Chifley) introduced the Ministers of State Bill. Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The purpose of this bill is to increase the salaries of Ministers of<br>
State. The Constitution made a temporary provision of œ 12,000 per<br>
annum for a maximum of seven Ministers, and left the way open for<br>
Parliament to make increased provision, both as regards the number of<br>
Ministers and the appropriation. On five occasions, increases have been<br>
made because of increased responsibility. The last occasion was<br>
in 1941, when the number of Ministers of State was increased from<br>
eleven to nineteen and the appropriation to œ 21,250. That change was<br>
made at the instance of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Menzies),<br>
who was then Prime Minister.<br>
Whereas the provision made in the Constitution 47 years ago was<br>
an average of approximately œ 1,710 per minister, under subsequent<br>
provision from time to time, the average has not only not increased in<br>
keeping with rising costs but has actually been less than under the<br>
original provision. In 1941 the average was œ 1,120, and there has<br>
-been no increase in the meantime. The whole of the appropriation for<br>
Ministers of State is not divided among the Ministers. A proportion is<br>
paid to the Cabinet fund, to meet the expenses of Cabinet, and these<br>
expenses have naturally increased. The ihcreasing responsibilities of<br>
Ministers, the many additional calls on their financial resources, and the<br>
rising costs, justify, in the opinion of the Government, some addition to<br>
the salaries provision. The present measure proposes to increase the<br>
appropriation from œ 21,250 to œ 27,650."" [ The bill was passed.<br>

FIGHTING FORCES.<br>
AWARDS-U. S. DECORATIONS.<br>
In Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Minister for Defenc-.<br>
( Mr. Dedman) said-<br>
I inform the House of decisions on proposals communicated by tht<br>
United States Government for the award of United States decorations<br>
to members of the Australian Defence Forces. The Government </p>
<p>received 229 proposals for the bestowal of United States awards which<br>
required extensive examination and correspondence with the service<br>
departments, and cablegrams to Britain, in the light of the rules<br>
governing the acceptance of foreign honours. The Australian Government<br>
has applied to the Australian forces the rules adopted by the<br>
British Government and communicated to the Australian and other<br>
British Commonwealth governments in 1942. One of the rules was that<br>
the scale of acceptance of United States awards by inenmbers of the<br>
Aius: ralian forces should, in general, be one acceptance for each British<br>
award granted to United States forces in the South-West Pacific Area.<br>
The Government represented to the British authorities that it would<br>
be loath to contemplate the wholesale rejection of awards sponsored by<br>
America for operational service for no other reason lthan that they<br>
would involve a departure from a numerical . balance. Further, by<br>
virtue of the close association of United States and Australian forces<br>
throughout the war in the South-West Pacific Area, the Government<br>
believed that it was fitting that acceptance of awards for operational<br>
service should be permitted on a generous scale for the final series of<br>
recommendations to mark the end of hostilities. The British authorities<br>
have agreed with this view, and consideration of the proposals has<br>
proceeded without regard to any of the limitations which would have<br>
been imposed if the one for one rule had applied.<br>
"" The Government has accepted 102 United States award. for<br>
gallantry or heroism, or for outstanding service directly in, or associated<br>
with, operations in an operational area. They include awards for<br>
Allied Intelligence Bureau parties which landed in enemy territory,<br>
for intelligence patrols, heroism and good service in action, coast<br>
watching in enemy territory, operational flights and strikes against<br>
the enemy, the rescue of survivors of crashed aircraft in enemy territory,<br>
and many other instances of gallantry and outstanding service in<br>
operations. The Government has expressed its appreciation of the offer<br>
of the United States Government and its pleasure in accepting them.<br>
The Government regrets that it is unable to accept United States awards<br>
in the following cases, and for the reasons stated:-<br>
United States awardf, fir inon-optratiotal service, acceptance of which is<br>
precluded by the policy of the ( Govemriiient, 21. ( These awards include<br>
proposals f'or the rrecoPiition of service in Australia. with general headquarters,<br>
and for ervicee in Washiiingtoni, all of which is non-operational.)<br>

award for the samile service. a'cept; nce of which nwould infringe the rule against<br>
duplication of recoinition. 35. ( The ptrinciple of this rule is that service<br>
rendcered during oiperations by a nilemtler of any British Commonwealth force<br>
is more properly recognized by an awird by his own Sovereign than by acceptance<br>
of foreign ioni( our. In noe of the-e euses have tlie services recommended that<br>
: nl exception be made to the application of the rule against duplication of<br>

which is recluded by tile rules ioverning the acceptance of foreign honours:-<br>
Awards for services for which United Staltes decorations were previously<br>
. ranted, five: Iposthumou s awards which, in the case of British awards, are<br>
permitted only for the Victoria Cross and George Cros,. and mentions il<br>
despatches and commenl dations,. six. </p>
<p>The total number of award. s which, for the reasons already stated,<br>
cannot be accepted, is 67. In certain cases, the proposed United States<br>
awards have been deferred for further examination by the services as to<br>
whether or not the service for which they are proposed was operational.<br>
There are 60 cases in this category, mos; of them being for service with<br>
general head-quarters, the greater proportion of which was on the<br>
mainland of Australia."" PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br>
POULTRY FARMING-EGG EXPORT CONTROL, BILL<br>
INTRODUCED.<br>
In, Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Minister for Commerce<br>
( Mr. Pollard) introduced the Egg Export Control Bill. Mr.<br>
Pollard said-<br>
The purpose of this bill is to provide for the constitution of an<br>
Australian Egg Board to regulate and control the export of eggs and<br>
egg products from Australia. In July, 1943, responsibility for the<br>
stabilization of egg prices and control of the marketing of eggs was<br>
assumed by the Commonwealth Egg Control organization, constituted<br>
under National Security ( Egg Industry) Regulations, and continued<br>
in force under the Defence ( Transitional Provisions) Act 1946. When<br>
this control ceases on 31st December, 1947, responsibility for marketing<br>
of eggs will revert to State egg boards, which will be responsible for<br>
stabilizing prices and marketing the production of their own States.<br>
The Australian Government recently concluded a long-term contract<br>
with . the British Government for the purchase of Australian eggs<br>
in shell, egg pulp and egg powder for the seasons 1947-48, 1948-49<br>
and 1949-50. To assist in the orderly marketing of the anticipated<br>
surplus, and to ensure that the conditions of the long-term contract are<br>
fulfilled, the Government has decided to establish an Australian Egg<br>
Board, which will supervise the disposal of that portion of surplus<br>
production which is of suitable quality for export. The bill provides<br>
for the establishment of a board of ten members, who will represent the<br>
following interests:-Egg Producers of Australia ( one from each<br>
State), 6; persons with commercial experience, 2; employees engaged in<br>
the handling, grading and processing of eggs, 1; Australian Government<br>
representative, 1; total, 19."" [ The bill was passed.<br>

INDUSTRIAL.<br>
DILUTION OF LABOUR-TRADESMEN'S RIGHTS, FURTHER<br>
BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Minister for Labour<br>
( Mr. Holloway) introduced the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Bill.<br>
Mr. Holloway said-<br>
This bill extends the principal provisions of the Tradesmen's<br>
Rights Regulation Act 1946 to the trades in the boot, shoe, sandal and<br>
1s4pper manufacturing industry which were subject to National Security<br>
( Boot Trades Dilution) Regulations. </p>
<p>The bill adds to the act another part and schedule, and makes<br>
consequen'wial amendments, so that recognized tradesmen in the boot<br>
trades shall be entitled to the same priority in employment in their<br>
trades as recognized engineering tradesmen receive in the engineering<br>
trades. That is to say, in the case of engagements, an employer may<br>
not employ on tradesmen's work a person other than a recognized<br>
tradesman if a competent tradesman is available and offering for<br>
employment; and in the case of dismissals or retrenchments, Iby another<br>
provision in the same section that a recognized tradesman shall be<br>
the last to go unless a local comm: nittee otherwise permits and subject<br>
to an employer exercising his award rights regarding summary<br>
dismissal. "" The bill provides for ex-servicemen to qualify as recognized<br>
tradesmen by a probationary period of training in employment under<br>
the supervision of a local ( boot trades) committee. These probationary<br>
tradesmen will receive the full tradesman's rate of pay during their<br>
probatonary period. Applications by ex-servicemen for authorization<br>
of their employment as probationary tradesmen must be made, unless<br>
there are special circumstances, within six -months after the date of<br>
discharge from the forces or the same period after the coming into<br>
operation of these amendments, whichever is the later.<br>

IJNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.<br>
On 25th November, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)<br>
said-For many months there has been a steady increase in the demand<br>
for labour in Australia accompanied by a progressive decline in<br>
unemployment. At October, 1947, recipients of unemployment benefit<br>
( including re-employment allowance) had fallen to a record low level<br>
of 2,945 ( 2,830 males and 115 females) representing less than one<br>
in 11,000 Australian workers. Unfilled vacancies held by the Commonwealth<br>
Employment Service numbered 52,200 for males and 35,200 for<br>
females, an increase of nearly 7,000 above the September total.<br>
It is difficult to find any occupation suitable for females in which<br>
unfilled vacancies do not greatly exceed available applicants. For<br>
example, in the clothing and textile trades the number of vacancies for<br>
women workers approaches 15,000.<br>
"" During October, 1947, the Commonwealth Employment Service<br>
referred 20, S00 males and 6,500 females to employers.""<br>

The functions of the Board of Review, although primarily associated<br>
with income tax, have, from time to time, been extended to<br>
include matters arising under sales tax, pay-roll tax, war-time ( company)<br>
tax, social services contribution, flour tax and entertainments<br>

determination has been such that one board has been unable to cope<br>
with it within a reasonable time.<br>
The new board will comprise the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation<br>
( Mr. H. H. Trebilco), chairman, Mr. J. A. Nimmo, and Mr. R. A.<br>

CONSTITUTION.<br>
AMENDMENT-REFERENDUM, PRICES, BILL<br>
INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 19th November, 1947, the Minister for Labour<br>
( Mr. Holloway) introduced the Constitution Alteration ( Rents and<br>
Prices) Bill. Mr. Holloway said-<br>
To safeguard the Australian people from inflation and depression,<br>
and to keep in check the profiteer and the racketeer, are nation-wide<br>
problems. They can be solved only by nation-wide action. The object<br>
of the bill is to amend the Constitution so as to give to the National<br>
Parliament the necessary powers. The bill proposes to give it the<br>
power to make laws with respect to ' rents and prices ( including<br>
charges) The powers will have to be exercised particularly throughout the<br>
present critical years or transition from war to peace. But the need<br>
for their exercise will not lapse when the transition is completed,<br>
however far ahead that may be. They will be needed again from time<br>
to time, whenever economic conditions become unstable. The object<br>
of the bill is to give permanent, nation-wide protection to every tenant,<br>
every income-earner, every housewife, to every user of services and,<br>
indeed, to every purchaser as well as to primary producers dependent<br>
on unsheltered markets.<br>
"" The proposed new power is one to make laws first and foremost<br>
about rents. In an economic sense, rents are only a particular group<br>
of prices. But there must be no doubt whether they are included in<br>
the power. They are a vital element in the life of the people. In<br>
the first place, rent absorbs a large proportion of the income of most<br>
families. Unless rents are kept at a reasonable figure, other forms of<br>
price control will not be effective to maintain the living standards of<br>
the community. Moreover, the shortage of housing is likely to last<br>
longer than other shortages, and rent control will therefore be essential<br>
for a long time. </p>
<p>A vital duty of a national government is to give its people that<br>
freedom from fear and want held out to them in the Atlantic Charter<br>
as one of the aims which made the sacrifices of the war worth while.<br>
I will show that the power to control rents and prices is a power without<br>
which the Commonwealth Parliament will be severely handicapped<br>
in carrying out this duty in the economic sphere. The Australian<br>
Government is convinced that the people should be given the opportunity<br>
to arm themselves, through their Parliament, with essential<br>
power. In the past, the economic security of the common man has been<br>
menaced lv recurring economic depressions bringing in their train the<br>
miseries nf unemployment and want. Those depressions have usually<br>
been preceded by periods of unhealthy expansion, leading to inflation<br>
and the crash from ' booin' to slump'. The horrors of war have<br>
always been followed by tlhis cycle-scarcely less terrible in its effects.<br>
In modern times, these economic troubles have not been coinfined to<br>
single countries, but have been world-wide. They are the result of<br>
mnan's activities or neglect, and it is within his power to prevent them.<br>
lThe problem of recurring depressions must be tackled on a world-wide<br>
basis, and Australia is playing its full part in the work being done in<br>
rthis direction. But an important part of the problem must be tackled<br>
within iiir own economy. Moreover, we must be ready to act quickly<br>
whenmiever tlie necessity arise-. The vital thing is to see that ' boom'<br>
condirions, ( if 1an unhealthy kind, which, as experience shows, lead to<br>
depression, . shall not develop. Further apart from the prospect of<br>
depression. another evil that must be fought vigorously in boom<br>
times and in times when houses and goods are in short supply is the<br>
evil of exploitation by profiteers. When money is plentiful among<br>
some sections of the community and houses and goods are scarce, unscrupulous<br>
landlords or vendors can, if not controlled, exploit the rest<br>
of the contimmuity. Even in times when goods are plentiful, the<br>
creation of monopolies leads to the same evil. We all know the<br>
enormous profits made during and after World War I. Thanks to rent<br>
and price control, there was much less profiteering in Australia during<br>
World War II., but the sudden removal of these controls at present<br>
would undoubtedly lead to profiteering. We have only to see what is<br>
happening in other countries, such as the United States, to realize this.<br>
In the United States, prices rose so steeply within a few months of the<br>
removal of control, that an attempt is now being made to replace price<br>
control. But with the flood-gates once opened who can say whether<br>
they can he shut again?<br>
No intelligent person would be so foolish as to think that all<br>
fluctuations in rents and prices can be avoided. If costs, especially<br>
eosts of imported goods and materials. are rising, prices must rise.<br>
But the people rely on their government to ensure that the rises shall<br>
be jiustificd. that increases of wages intended to improve living stanlards<br>
shall do so and shall not be made the excuse for unreasonable<br>
price and rent increases. I will show later that an essential weapon in </p>
<p>the two battles against depression and exploitation is the power to control<br>
rents and prices. I will also show that the States are not in a<br>
position to handle those weapons effectively. The people will rightly<br>
look to the National Parliament to grapple with these national<br>
problems. The Government is confident that they will freely grant the<br>
powers necessary to enable it to do so.<br>
The bill does not mean that the Government considers that it will<br>
be necessary to operate price control indefinitely, or to operate it in<br>
the detailed and complete form to which we have become accustomed<br>
over recent years. Price control in that form is necessary only in a<br>
period of general excess of demand over supply, a condition which is<br>
now being steadily removed. As shortages disappear, so can price control<br>
disappear, until it will become essentially a reserve power, operating<br>
only when and where it is required for the health of the economy.<br>
Price control will be required beyond the transition period in relation,<br>
for instance, to houses and rents, where shortages must be expected to<br>
continue for some time. Where production of certain commodities is<br>
under the control of monopolies, price control may be necessary to ensure<br>
that the industry concerned shall apply a policy of high output, low<br>
prices and moderate profits, rather than a policy of low output, high<br>
prices and excessive profits. Similarly, where industries have been<br>
granted tariff protection to enable them to carry on against overeas<br>
competition, price control will be essential to ensure that this tariff<br>
protection shall not be used to exploit local consumers.<br>
Periods of expanding activity occure from time to time in any<br>
economy, as a result, for instance, of the development of new public and<br>
private investment. It will be possible for price control to check the<br>
increase of prices that would other wise result from this pressure of<br>
demand on resources of production. It is the effect on costs of this<br>
increase of prices which has in the past led businessmen suddenly to<br>
change their minds about undertaking new production, and which has<br>
led to financial crises followed by prolonged depression. If price control<br>
can prevent the development of this inflationary tendency, that<br>
alone will be the greatest single factor contributing to the avoidance<br>
of depression. In the other direction, continual difficulty has been<br>
caused in the Australian economy by the violent collapses of overseas<br>
prices for exports Price control cannot prevent these falls, but, when<br>
drops occur, price control can, by maintaining minimum local prices,<br>
help to cushion their effects of primary producers' incomes and on the<br>
Australian economy generally.<br>
i turn now to a consideration of the immediate need for rent and<br>
price control in Australia during the period of transition from war to<br>
peace. I need not draw in great detail the picture of what would happen<br>
if the present rent control were removed. Although good progress is<br>
being made with housing, there must inevitably be a shortage for a long<br>
time. But while any shortage remains there must be protection for<br>
home-seekers against extortionate charges for accommodation. After<br>
World War rents rose steadily, right up to the beginning of the </p>
<p>depression in 1929, by which time they were 50 per cent. higher than<br>
in 1918. Even in normal times the rack-renter is always with us. L<br>
am not saying that all landlords are grasping and unscrupulous-far<br>
from it. But there are always some-and their number tends to grow<br>
with opportunity-who are willing to take the last penny from people<br>
whenever there is either a general shortage or a local shortage such as<br>
occurs from time to time in particular places.<br>
"" On prices generally, there can be no doubt that external and<br>
internal inflationary pressures will continue for some time. Prices of<br>
imported goods are now more than two and a half times their pre-wr<br>
level and are still rising. These cost inreases_ have been pressing<br>
throughout the war, and have, thanks to price control, been absorbed by<br>
the economy with a minimum of disturbance. Internal pressures are<br>
equally strong. Income of primary producers, enjoying record<br>
production and record prices, will be at an all-time high<br>
level this year. Prices for exported goods are more than two<br>
and a half times their pre-war level. There have been substantial<br>
increases of the basic wage and of skill margins this year. Wage costs<br>
will be still further increased by the adoption of the 40-hour working<br>
week throughout Australia, on 1st January, 1948. There is, in addition,<br>
a large volume of liquid balances accumulated by the people as a<br>
result of war-timue shortages, and still awaiting spending. Prices control<br>
has so far given owners of savings an assurance that the real value<br>
of these balances will : be maintained. A threat to the continuance of<br>
price stability, as a result of the cessation of price control, may cause a<br>
wave of buying a, a hedge against inflation and thus bring about the<br>
inflation that we fear. Against this high and increasing volume if<br>
spending power, there is a serious deficiency of goods. Despite our high<br>
export income, imports are held back by dollar shortages and the production<br>
difficulties of easier currency areas. like Britain, Europe and<br>
Asia. We may not be able to import even enough goods to balance our<br>
exports, let alone to import surplus goods to meet excess spending<br>
pressure. In the domestic sphere, production is at a high and<br>
increasing level, but is still seriously short of the people's needs. The<br>
postponement of capital replacement and expansion during the<br>
war requires an abnormally large proportion of current production to be<br>
devoted to the production of capital goods. In addition to this heavy<br>
and continuing drain on resources to meet capital requirement, shortages<br>
of labour and materials and the hangover of war-time disorganization<br>
of production are causing bottlenecks in several lines of essential<br>
production. An important feature of the Australian economy at present is the<br>
substantial subsidies being paid by the Government to prevent cost<br>
increases from passing into the price structure. An abrupt removal of<br>
these subsidies, as would be required by the cessation of price control,<br>
would cause an equally abrupt rise in prices. This represents an inflatinarvy<br>
force which must be controlled until it can safely be released.<br>
With all these inflationary forces at work in Australia, it cannot be </p>
<p>doubted that an immediate relaxation of price control would lead inevitably<br>
to price increases comparable with those that have occurred<br>
recently in the United States. There, within five month. s of the<br>
abandonment of price control, retail prices generally rose by 14 per<br>
cent. and food prices by 29 per cent. Those figures should : be compared<br>
with the increase of prices in Australia, where in the two years<br>
since the end of the war, the rise have been only 6 per cent. for prices<br>
generally, and 7 per cent. for food alone.<br>
The war-time history of price control gives us firm ground for<br>
confidence that it brings real advantages to the community and that it is<br>
po.'-ible to administer price control successfully. Rent control during<br>
the war was amazingly successful. Rents on an average increased by<br>
less than I per cent. During World War retail prices rose by 32 per<br>
cenlt. and two yea'rs later they were 70 per cent. above pre-war. During<br>
World War II., they rose by 23 per cent., and two years later they are<br>
only 30 per cent. above the pre-war level. World War II. lasted<br>
six year-as againl-t four yrcars and involved a far greater strain oil<br>
resource.-. rThpio'st -war | iriod has also been far more difficult, due : o<br>
the greater dislocation in Australia and overseas. Apart from our own<br>
arrears of civilian production, the war-torn countries of Europe and<br>
Asia have not been able to make anything like their normal contribution<br>
to our needs. Instead, they have been a drain on our supplies. In<br>
spite of far greater shortages and disorganization of production, price<br>
control has thus far saved Australia from the worst effect of a second<br>
post-war boom. If it is continued through the transition period, we<br>
may reasonably hope to avoid the worst effects of a slump such as<br>
occurred in 1921.<br>
Although, with the full concurrence of the State governments, the<br>
Commonwealth assumed full power to control rents and prices at the<br>
outbreak of the war. it has exercised these powers only to the extent<br>
rendered strictly necessary : by circumstances arising out of the war.<br>
During the first two and a half years of the war, for instance, only a<br>
relatively frew commodities were made subject to control, because general<br>
short:;: ze wcre not apparent until after the Pacific war broke oit.<br>
When it i. s realized that the post-war boom lasted two years after World<br>
War which was so much milder in its economic effect than World<br>
War it can be understood why no great measure of de-control has<br>
becn permitted up to the present stage, early in the third post-war year.<br>
Nevertheless. the Government looks forward to the time when it will 1x'<br>
able to lay down the burden of assessing most price increases, and t'i<br>
revert to the state of affairs before the Japanese war, when only a<br>
relatively small number of items was scarce and under control, and<br>
traders did their own pricing under a formula, subject only to<br>
occasional check.<br>
"" Recently. the Commonwealth Government has returned to State<br>
and local governments control of goods and services handled by State,<br>
semi-governmental and local-governing bodies, including tronsport, gas </p>
<p>27<br>
and electricity undertakings, and locally produced and consumed goods<br>
and services, such as milk and taxi-cab fares. A considerable extension<br>
of this process will take place, in consultation with the States.<br>
The amendment of the Constitution proposed would give the Conmmonwealth<br>
Parliament power to legislate with respect to rents and<br>
prices, including charges. The power over rents would cover the<br>
fixing or pegging' of rents, would include power to provide for the<br>
determination of fair rents and, as an incidental matter, to protect<br>
tenants against eviction. It would apply to rents of goods as well arents<br>
of land and buildings. The power with respect to prices would<br>
enable Parliament to control and regulate the prices at which property<br>
uf any kind, including commodities, land and shares in companies, is<br>
sold. Explicit power to control charges is included in the bill to remove<br>
any doubt about charges which are in the nature of prices or rents, but<br>
in relation to which the term prices or rents' may not be ordinarily<br>
used; for example, charges for hairdressing or for board and lodging.<br>
The words would also include charges for the use of money, or, in other<br>
words, interest.<br>
"" Since minimum prices, as well as maximum prices, could be fixed<br>
under the power, it could be used to ensure a home-consumption price<br>
for primary products. Minimum prices could also be used to prevent<br>
disorder and losses to holders of stocks of imported goods which could<br>
follow a sudden collapse of raw material prices overseas. Further,<br>
the new power would make clear the right of the Commonwealth to<br>
pay subsidies to maintain reasonable prices to consumers as well as<br>
producers for essential goods, such as potatoes and dairy products.<br>
"" Control over rents and prices by the Commonwealth is at prese: t<br>
carried on by regulations in force under the Defence ( Transitional<br>
Provisions) Act. That act depends for its validity on the defence<br>
power' of the Commonwealth. The High Court has held that I he<br>
extension of the defence power to measures necessary to the economic<br>
stability of the country does not cease abruptly with the end of hostilities<br>
in a war. The power retains a wide scope during the period of<br>
transition from conditions of war to conditions of peace; -but the scope<br>
of the power is constantly dwindling, and it affords a very uncertain<br>
basis for measures essential to Australia's economic stability. With this<br>
consideration in view, the Government sought the assistance of the Stale<br>
governments, all of which expressed willingness to support the contiuunnce<br>
of price control on a national basis during the post-war transition<br>
period. In some States this legislation has expired and in others<br>
will shortly do so. Further, there is little prospect of this legislation<br>
hieng extended in all or even a majority of States. This creates the<br>
position that, in some States price control now virtually rests on the<br>
defence power, and will have ! egal validity only for as long as that<br>
power is held to support it. Even if there were any certainty that the<br>
defence power is adequate to cover the winding-up of war-time controls </p>
<p>and measures necessary during the period of transition to conditions of<br>
peace, the Commonwealth would still be without adequate power to deal<br>
with and guard against future economic disturbances. The permanent<br>
power to act effectively and promptly in economic crises is, in the<br>
opinion of the Government, an essential power of a national parliament<br>
quite apart from present circumstances. It is very likely that there<br>
will be long periods during which these powers will not be exercised, or<br>
will be exercised only in limited fields, but they will be a vital weapon in<br>
the nation's defences against inflationary booms, followed by economic<br>
depressions. It is these circumstances which have led the Government<br>
to recommend to Parliament that the people be asked, by way of referendum,<br>
to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate for<br>
the control of rents and prices.<br>
As rent is one of the main items in living costs for the average<br>
person, movements in rents have an important influence on social and<br>
economic stability. State governments have power to control rents,<br>
but it is unlikely that they will all do so at the same time, in the same<br>
way. We have seen earlier what happened to rents after the last war,<br>
when control could have been exercised only by State governments.<br>
If rents are allowed to rise in one , State, but not in others, wages will<br>
rise in that State above the general level. With wages, many other<br>
costs and prices will rise as well. As a result the whole economy may<br>
be thrown out of balance. In practical terms, uniform control of rents<br>
can be secured only if it is applied by the Commonwealth Government.<br>
State government. s have power to control prices. But mainly<br>
because commodities can move freely between States, it is not practicable<br>
for State governments to control more than a limited range of commodities<br>
produced and sold locally. Where goods such as galvanized<br>
iron are produced in only one State it would be impracticable for the<br>
Government of any importing State to maintain an adequate control<br>
over consumers prices while prices charged by the imanufacturers were<br>
beyond their control. Consequently, since the States have only a limited<br>
practical power to control prices, and the Commonwealth has not, in<br>
normal peace-time, any legal power to do so, there is not any really<br>
effective power to control prices anywhere within the country. This,<br>
obviously, is a serious anomaly.<br>
Siress has already been laid on the responsibility of the Commonwealth<br>
for the preservation of economic stability. This means, in plain<br>
terms, the prevention of booms' and slumps', which, in the past,<br>
have brought so much loss, unemployment and misery. It means the<br>
maintenance of steady incomes for producers, in town and country alike.<br>
It means the preservation of a stable purchasing power for money, and<br>
the protection and improvement of living standards for the various<br>
clasaes within the community. This is of particular importance to </p>
<p>pensioners, people with fixed incomes, and all who contribute to the<br>
savings of the community. Control of prices is wrapped up with all<br>
these things. Rises and falls of prices are part and parcel of booms<br>
and ' slumps'. They determine also the value of money, and the distribution<br>
of the national output among the community.<br>
Control of profiteering and monopolies again is closely bound up<br>
with prices, and this is a field in which, for the most part, only Commonwealth<br>
action can be effective. Since monopolies are often nation-wide<br>
in scope, State governments are virtually powerless to deal with them.<br>
Many of the special functions of the Commonwealth are dependent on<br>
a power to regulate prices. The Commonwealth, for example, is concerned<br>
with the overseas marketing of exports. Primary producers are<br>
only too well aware that high prices are likely to be followed by low<br>
prices. All systems of guaranteed prices and home-consumption prices<br>
designed to promote orderly marketing will be greatly strengthened if<br>
the Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate for minimum<br>
prices. Such a power would overcome many of the difficulties created<br>
in the rural economy by section 92 of the Constitution.<br>
Again, it is the Commonwealth which fixes levels of tariff protection<br>
for local industries. it does so with a view to assisting such<br>
industries to establish themselves and expand. Unless prices charged<br>
by local industries for their products can be supervised and regulated,<br>
there is always a risk that tariff protection : may be abused and the<br>
community exploited. Producers are likely to rely on tariff protection<br>
to maintain their high prices, instead of increasing their efficiency and<br>
moderating their profits to reduce their prices.<br>
All these considerations add up to an overwhelming case for giving<br>
the Commonwealth power to legislate on rents and prices. It is the<br>
only authority in Australia which can exercise such power effectively.<br>
It has had such a power during the war and the post-war period, and<br>
has used it with highly beneficial results. It will need such a power in<br>
the future if it is to preserve and advance the economic welfare of the<br>
nation through a time which threatens very great dangers and<br>
difficulties. There is no short-cut to this end, and we should be warned<br>
by the example of other countries that the quick and easy step of<br>
abandoning all controls can bring far worse troubles than those it was<br>
sought to avoid. Unless the power to control prices is written into the<br>
Cons'itution now, it will not be available to the Australian people when<br>
it is most needed.<br>
The question is not political. It is a simple question, as every<br>
Australian should realize, of making sure that nation-wide protection<br>
can be given in times of difficulty to the tenant, the wage-earner, and the<br>
housewife, to the primary producer, and, in fact, to every Australian<br>
who has to pay for land, or goods, or services of any kind-in other<br>
words, to every Australian."" [ The bill was passed.<br>

<p>COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION.<br>
SPECIAL GRANTS 1947-48.<br>
In Par it-ment.-On 19th November, 1947, the Prime Minister<br>
( Mr. Chifley) introduced the State Grants Bill. Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The object of this bill is to obtain the approval of the Parliament<br>
to the payment, during 1947-48, of special grants aggregating<br>
œ 5,042,000 to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and<br>
Tasmania. Provision for the payment of these grants follows recommendations<br>
of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The commission<br>
recommended that special grants aggregating œ 6,050,000 be paid to<br>
the claimant States in 1947-48, but added that these recommendations<br>
were made on the assumption that the amount of tax reimbursement to<br>
the States, œ 40,000,000, and the shares of this amount allotted to -the<br>
claimant States remain unchanged in 1947-48. The commission therefore<br>
stipulated that in -he event of any claimant State receiving in<br>
1947-48 more or less by way of tax reimbursement than it received in<br>
1946-47, the commission's recommendation should be adjusted by the<br>
amount of such increase or reduction. The bill authorizes the payment<br>
of an additional tax reimbursement grant of œ 5,000,000 to the States<br>
in 1947-48 under the uniform tax plan. Of this amount, South Australia,<br>
Western Australia and Tasmania will receive œ 432,000, œ 423,000<br>
and œ 153,000 respectively. In accordance with the recomnmendation of<br>
the commission these amounts must be deducted to arrive at the special<br>
grants which the commission considera should be paid this year. On<br>
this basis, the special grants payable in 1947-48 compare with those<br>
actually paid last year as follows:-1940-47. 1947-4.?.<br>

NATIONAL OIL PTY. LTD.-GLEN DAVIS PROJECT,<br>
MINISTER'S REVIEW.<br>
In Parliamenl.-On 4th December, 1947, the Minister for Supply<br>
( Senator Ashley) said-<br>
The experiments at Glen Davis have proved to be very costly.<br>
While flow oil is availalle there will be no possibility of oil produced<br>
from shale competing with it; it is not economically possible. The<br>
Government has spent a considerable sum of money and has taken the<br>
best possible advice in regard to the experiments at Glen Davis, and an<br>
appreciation of the development there has to be made. I do not regard<br>
the considerable atount of money that has been expended as being<br>
entirely wasted, because, as a result of the development at Glen Davis,<br>
we know as much about the production of oil from shale as most other<br>
countries in the world at the present time. The development is still<br>
continuing and it is anticipated that at Glen Davis the oil will be produced<br>
at a cost of approximately 2s. a gallon. However, even with<br>
mass production methods, the retorts situated on the side of the shale,<br>
and all the other ingredients available on the spot, the venture is not<br>
profitable at present, and I do not think the Government would be<br>
interested in supplying further capital for shale oil production in<br>
Australia."" EXTERNAL TERRITORIES.<br>

<p>BRITAIN.<br>
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS.<br>
On 26th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
' A report received yesterday on the commitment for imports in<br>
1947-48 from dollar sources leaves the Government no option but to<br>
make further savings in Australia's dollar commitment. The drift in<br>
the dollar position of the whole sterling area is serious and the latest<br>
figures of the dollar drain are particularly disturbing.<br>
Australia is, as a result of the nature of its international trade, a<br>
net purchaser of dollars from the pool, and if the pooling system were<br>
to break down the resultant dislocation to the Australian economy<br>
would be very serious. But it is very clear that every sterling area<br>
country, including Australia, has to ration itself severely on dollars<br>
if the pooling system is to survive. Last year Australia had a substantial<br>
deficit in its dollar trade. The total commitment revealed in<br>
the report of the special committee investigating the matter showed big<br>
increases over last year's imports from the dollar area. On the other<br>
band, Australian exports to the dollar area are not yet up to last year's<br>
rate. Outstanding import licences were recalled for review on Sth<br>
October, 1947, by the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice). At<br>
that time, importers were asked to defer shipment until the review was<br>
completed in the hope that in the final analysis some arrangement<br>
could be made to confirm the licences. The position has now become<br>
so grave that the Government is reluctantly compelled to cancel all<br>
licences recalled for review except those covering goods shipped to<br>
Australia on or before 23st October, 1947; those covered by irrevocable<br>
letters of credit; anld those for goods included in the list announced<br>
by the Minister as having a high degree of essentiality. The importation<br>
of any goods from dollar sources without a licence is prohibited<br>
and importers in their own interests should immediately notify their<br>
suppliers of the cancellation.<br>
"" Only a limited amount of dollars can be made available for the<br>
issue of new licences for goods from dollar sources to be imported<br>
before 30th June, 1948. The Customs Department has been instructed<br>
to ensure that this amount is allocated only to the highest priority<br>
goods. The committee has also made recommendations for further savings<br>
in regard to certain items involving heavy dollar expenditure which<br>
were not included in the licences recalled for review. These recommendationlu<br>
will be considered by Cabinet on 8th December, 1947.<br>
There is little likelihood of any early easing of the critical dollar<br>
position and, for the future, it has been decided to operate the licensing<br>
of goods from dollar areas on a quota system associated with a budget<br>
ceiling. \ An announcement will be made by Senator Courtice of the<br>
procedure to be followed by importers to establish base year quotas.<br>
7858.-2 </p>
<p>It is clear that the cancellation of licences will interfere with some<br>
production programmes in Australia and the decision has been taken<br>
with the greatest reluctance. The effect of the cancellation can, in<br>
many cases, be absorbed by stock adjustments or new sources of supply<br>
and users of goods are urged to use their utmost resourcefulness in<br>
overcoming the difficulties ahead.""<br>
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLARS, TRAVEL.<br>
On 4th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
In view of the deterioration in the dollar position the Government<br>
has decided that approval will not be given to the provision of<br>
dollars for travel for personal reasons. Except in special circumstances,<br>
travel involving dollar expenditure will be restricted to visits<br>
for business purposes which are important from the point of view of<br>
maintaining essential industry or industrial development. In the case<br>
of busine-s visits which would still qualify for the provision of dollars,<br>
a further reduction has been made in the amount which may be<br>
provided."" FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS, PRIME<br>
MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br>
In Parliament.-On 4th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
"" At present there is practically a world-wide shortage of United<br>
States dollars. Among regions affected are Britain, Australia, New<br>
Zealand, India and the other countries of the sterling area, most of<br>
Europe, Canada and the South and Central American countries. For<br>
most of the world, Canadian dollars are also scarce while Canada is<br>
faced with an acute shortage of United States dollars.<br>
Although other factors have contributed to this situation, the most<br>
important cause is the disparity between levels of production in the<br>
United States on the one hand and in Europe and Asia ( including<br>
Indonesia) on the other hand. Restoration of the war-devastated<br>
countries has in general been slow, with the resultr that they have been<br>
able neitier to produce the normal proportion of their own needs nor<br>
to re-cstablili their export trade. Hence there has been a concentration<br>
of demilland on the United States and Canada, where production has<br>
risen more rapidly than elsewhere. The position has been greatly<br>
aggravated by the increase in United States prices, particularly during<br>
the past year.<br>
On recent figures, the rate of exports from the United States has<br>
exceeded the rate of imports by about 10 billion dollars a year.<br>
Whereas during the early post-war period contributions such as those<br>
made under U. N. R. R. A. and the large dollar loans made by United<br>
i </p>
<p>States and Canada eased the position for a number of countries, the<br>
greater part of such aid had, by the middle of 1947, been exhausted and<br>
dollar deficits are now for the most part being met by drawings on<br>
gold and dollar reserves. In most cases such reserves are dwindling<br>
rapidly and cannot sustain for long the present rate of drawings on<br>
them. In efforts to reduce the dollar gap in their balances of payments,<br>
most countries have by now imposed severe restrictions on United<br>
States goods.<br>
There can be. no satisfactory solution to the present dollar problem<br>
until European production and trade are . brought into balance with<br>
Western Hemisphere production. To a large extent this will require a<br>
reconstruction of the European economy and the Marshall Plan is<br>
based on such a concept. It calls for the utmost co-operation and<br>
mutual help between European countries themselves as a condition of<br>
further aid from the United States. The participating countries have<br>
submitted a four-year reconstruction programme for which they are<br>
seeking United States aid to the extent of 22 billion dollars. The<br>
United States Congress is now considering interim proposals for<br>
assistance valued at 597 million dollars to Austria, Italy and France to<br>
cover the needs of these countries until 31st March, 1948. Committees<br>
have been examining the longer term proposals. However, even if the<br>
long term proposals are approved, it is not intended that the assistance<br>
will begin to be available until April, 1948, or later.<br>
Britain emerged from World War II. with her productive structure<br>
seriously impaired and her external income from exports and overseas<br>
investments greatly reduced. She needed a certain level of imports,<br>
largely from the United States to maintain a reasonable living standard<br>
and to supply raw materials and replace capital equipment. With her<br>
overseas investments largely liquidated and her shipping depleted,<br>
exports were the only substantial means of payment remaining, but<br>
even these had fallen by the end of World War II. to 40 per cent. of<br>
the pre-war . volume. It was estimated that the volume of exports would<br>
have to rise to 75 per cent. above pre-war before Britain's overseas<br>
payments would balance again. It was against this background that the<br>
United States loan of 3,750,000,000 dollars was negotiated to assist<br>
Britain in its transitional period. The United States loan became<br>
available on 15th July, 1946. It was estimated that the loan would<br>
last for two to three years. However, it was used up in just over<br>
twelve months, largely because of-<br>
The rapid increase in American price levels; the slow recovery of production<br>
in Europe and Asia; the severe 1946-47 winter in Britain which dislocated<br>
British production; and the demands of other countries for conversion of sterling<br>
into dollars after 15th July, 1947, when sterling became formally convertible<br>
into dollars under the Loan Agreement ( Convertibility was suspended on<br>
August, 1947).<br>

SThese tables indicate that although the listed countries used<br>
œ stg. l125,000,000 of their sterling holdings for expenditure in the dollar<br>
area by converting sterling into dollars or by transferring sterling to<br>
American account, the United Kingdom short-term liabilities to the<br>
same countries declined by only œ stg. 2,700,000 over the period 1st January,<br>
1947, to 31st August, 1947. Thus the movement into dollars<br>
resulted from expenditure in the dollar area of currently earned<br>
sterling rather than a withdrawal of accumulated sterling balances.<br>
However, most of the countries concerned added to their sterling<br>
balances during the first six months of the year and drew heavily against<br>
them in the June-August period. The drain over this latter period<br>
accentuated the running down of the American loan and made inevitable<br>
the suspension of convertibility of sterling into dollars.<br>
On 7th August, 1947, Dr. Dalton informed the House of Commons<br>
that British gold and dollar reserves amounted to about 2,400,000,000<br>
dollars. As there is a limit ' below which the British Government could </p>
<p>not permit these reserves to fall, it became necessary, after exhaustion<br>
of the American loan, to devise means of reducing the dollar deficit<br>
drastically enough to safeguard these reserves, which are the reserves not<br>
only of Britain but also of the whole sterling area.<br>
"" Britain took the lead in imposing very heavy restrictions on<br>
dollar imports, instituting a renewed export drive and curtailing the use<br>
of dollars on travel, films, military expenditure, and so on. The effect<br>
of these restrictions was to reduce Britain's dollar import programme<br>
for 194S by 400,000,000 dollars.<br>
On 24th October, 1947, Dr. Dalton informed the House of Commons<br>
that the rate of drain was still about 70,000,000 dollars a week, or<br>
about 3,600,000,000 dollars a year.<br>
"" On 23rd October, 1947, Sir Stafford Cripps stated that, as a result<br>
of the various measures taken, it was estimated that by the end of 1948<br>
the dollar deficit would be running at a rate not greater than<br>
1,000,000,000 dollars a year, by which time the reserves remaining would<br>
only be something over 1,000,000,000 dollars.<br>
To assist in meeting the position, Britain has drawn 180,000,000<br>
dollars from the International Monetary Fund against its yearly quota<br>
of 325,000,000 dollars. It has also negotiated with South Africa a<br>
loan of gold to the value of 320,000,000 dollars, but has had to ship to<br>
the United States gold to the value of 220,000,000 dollars in payment for<br>
goods. It is clear that, unless the rate of drain from reserves can be<br>
reduced by further cuts in dollar expenditure, there will be no alternative<br>
for sterling area countries but to live within their current dollar<br>
earnings. Even if the long-term proposals contained in the Marshall<br>
Plan are approved and Britain benefits to some extent directly, any<br>
significant improvement in the British position can only come from<br>
the restoration of the European countries.<br>
"" These benefits can be expected to mature only gradually. It is<br>
emphasized that the immediate relief contemplated by the United States<br>
Government for European countries is comparatively small and is confined<br>
to France, Italy and Austria and it may be several months before<br>
even this becomes effective. Even if approved by Congress the major<br>
measures of the Marshall Plan may not come into operation for a considerable<br>
time and it should be realized that the principal form of<br>
aid at present contemplated is a contribution of foodstuffs, industrial<br>
materials and equipment. This will help to reduce the dependence of<br>
the countries concerned on dollar supplies. But it will not directly<br>
relieve Britain's problem of securing payment in dollar-convertible<br>
currencies for her exports to those countries.<br>
The grave economic difficulties with which Britain is confronted,<br>
largely as a result of her sacrifices during the war, must be a matter of<br>
much concern to all other members of the British Commonwealth.<br>
Among the greatest of these difficulties is the dollar shortage. The<br>
Australian Government desires to do everything in its power to assist </p>
<p>39<br>
Britain in overcoming her dollar difficulties. For this reason the<br>
Government announced on 4th September, 1947, that it had been<br>
decided to sell, for the time being, current gold production to Britain<br>
as a special measure of assistance. Before this, Au, ralia's current<br>
production lhd leen added to the gold reserve.<br>
It must be realized that the normal pattern of Australia's overseas<br>
trade is such that we are usually not drawers on the sterling area dollar<br>
pool in respect of both Unites States and Canadian dollars. During<br>
the war years, when a large number of American troops were stationed<br>
in Australia, dollar accruals substantially exceeded dollar outgoings.<br>
The net surplus of dollars was sold to Britain for sterling and was used<br>
by Britain in the prosecution of the war. With the removal of American<br>
troops from the Australian theatre and the cessation of hostilities ( and<br>
with it, the termination of Lend-Lease), Australia's international<br>
receipts and payments resumed their traditional pattern and it again<br>
became necessary to purchase dollars for sterling from Britain to cover<br>
out net dollar deficit. This deficit has tended to be larger than in<br>
pre-war years because of the factors already mentioned as underlying<br>
the whole problem of the world-wide dollar shortage-the slow recovery<br>
of production in Europe and Asia and the rise in American pri,: e<br>
levels. "" Conservation of both United S: ates and Canadian dollars is<br>
an inescapable necessity for Australia. We can, of course, help by<br>
increasing our exports to the dollar area. Wool is our greatest dollar<br>
elarner, but the scale of American wool purchases is governed by factors<br>
largely outside our control. Exports of wool to the United , States in<br>
1946-47 were valued at œ A. 25,900,000. This figure does not include<br>
wool valued at œ A. 9,900,000 which, although shipped during 1946-47,<br>
had been purchased at issue prices during 1945-46 from the Australian<br>
Wool Realization Commission before the resumption of the wool<br>
auctions. The Australian Wool Realization Commission expects sales of<br>
wool to America during 1947-48 to be less in quantity than in 1946-47.<br>
This reduction in quantity will be partly offset by the rise in wool prices<br>
Iut the commission, on present indications, expects the value of sales<br>
to the United States to be slightly less than last year. In addition, the<br>
commi-sion anticipn'c thte!' r wli1 some small sales to Canada and<br>
other countries which will pay in dollars.<br>
The Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) is examining the<br>
possibility of increasing exports of other commodities to the dollar<br>
area. There is at presnt a strong demand in the Unied States for<br>
various raw and manufactured products produced in Australia, but, in<br>
many instances, exports have been restricted to preserve adequate<br>
supplies to meet the needs of the home market. We may, however.<br>
have to consider whether additional quantities of sone of these goods<br>
can be released for export to earn dollars to pay for more essential<br>
goods which we need to import from dollar sources to keep our<br>
industries operating.<br>
7858.-4 </p>
<p>"" Since the outbreak of war in 1939, imports from the dollar area<br>
have in general been limited to essential goods not available in adequate<br>
quantities from sterling sources of supply. However, in present circumstances,<br>
a great many items are obtainable only from the dollar area<br>
: and the great development which has taken place in Australian industry<br>
has increased the demand for imported machinery and raw materials.<br>
During the period immediately following the cessation of hostilities,<br>
when reconversion of American production to a peace-time basis was<br>
incomplete, the level of dollar imports was limited by lack of availability.<br>
During the current year, however, American production has<br>
caught up with the backlog of domestic demand in many fields and<br>
many items have come into free supply for the export trade. This,<br>
coupled with the steep rise in dollar prices, has led to a very rapid<br>
growth in the value of dollar goods imported into Australia. Our<br>
imports from the United States and Canada in 1946-47 were valued at<br>
œ A. 63,000,000, on the recorded basis of f. o. b. plus 10 per cent. In the<br>
first four months of 1947-48, imports from the United States and<br>
Canada were about œ A. 41,000,000-an annual rate of œ A. 123,000,000.<br>
Accurate estimates of Australia's balance of paymeuts with individual<br>
countries are difficult to obtain, particularly because of the high<br>
propor: ion of our overseas trade which is financed through London.<br>
However, on 30th September, 1947, the House was informed that, on the<br>
basis of such information as is available, it was estimated that in 1946-47<br>
Australia's dollar deficit amounted to about 100 million dollars.<br>
"" Following the suspension of convertibility of sterling into dollars<br>
and the exhaustion of the American loan, the Commonwealth Government<br>
took stock of the position and decided on certain measures to<br>
reduce the size of Australia's deficit for 1947-48 and thus reduce the<br>
demands we would have to ' make on Britain to provide us with dollars<br>
from their ultimate reserve of gold and dollars.<br>
"" Following the September decisions, Australian officials were sent<br>
to London at the request of the BritisL Government to participate in<br>
discussions between representatives of the various sterling area countries<br>
on the general dollar situation and the steps required to meet it. Those<br>
talks revealed that the rate of drain on the British gold and dollar<br>
reserves was even more serious than had been realized and the British<br>
authorities requested that Australia should undertake to live within<br>
its current dollar income and to make no net claim on Britain for<br>
dollars. The Commonwealth Government felt unable to give a rigid<br>
undertaking. Since our dollar earnings are apt to vary widely from<br>
year to year there could be no certainty as to what such a commitment<br>
would entail. But it was evident that should our dollar income decline<br>
heavily we might find ourselves unable to fulfil such an undertaking<br>
without causing excessive dislocation to Australian industry. The<br>
Government did, however, undertake to co-operate with the British<br>
Government in reducing dollar expenditure to the fullest practicable<br>
extent.<br>
i' 1 </p>
<p>41<br>
"" When the September review was made, no clear picture was<br>
available of the extent to which we were alrecady comnitted to expenditure<br>
of dollars by import licences already granted. Statistics were<br>
available on the total value of licences issued, but it was not known<br>
to what extent the goods covered by these licences had already been<br>
imnportedl or what proportion was still to come forward. Accordingly,<br>
early in October, 1947, all outstanding dollar import licences ( except<br>
for certain commodities covered by special arrangements), were recalled<br>
for review, to establish more precisely the extent of our dollar commitments<br>
for imports during 1947-48 and to enable consideration to be<br>
given to the possibilities of further economies in dollar expenditure.<br>
* An inter-departmental committee was subsequently appointed to<br>
examine the figures obtained from the review of import licences and to<br>
make recommendations on the steps necessary to reduce dollar imports<br>
in 1947-48 to a figure which we could hope to finance from current<br>
dollar earnings and dollars available from Britain.<br>
"" This committee has presented an initial report which indicated<br>
that, despite the September dollar cute, outstanding commitments were<br>
so high that, in the absence of further measures, imports from the<br>
United States and Canada during 1947-48 would exceed œ A. 100,000,000,<br>
as against œ A. 63,000,000 for 1946-47. Even if dollar earnings during<br>
1947-48 reach the 1946-47 level, it is clear that with imports of over<br>
œ EA. 100,000,000, Australia's dollar deficit for 1947-48 would be considerably<br>
greater than la. 9t year's, notwithstanding the sale of current<br>
gold output.<br>
wa"" The picture disclosed by the inter-departmental committee's report<br>
wsso serious that the Government felt compelled to take drastic action<br>
to reduce dollar expenditure on imports during 1947-48 and to ensure<br>
that the rate of importation throughout the whole of 1948 would hwe<br>
confined to levels which it would be practicable to finance. The total<br>
value of dollar import licences recalled for review was œ A.. 52,000,000.<br>
Action is being-taken to confirm these licences in all cases where goods<br>
were in transit, irrevocable letters of credit had been established and the<br>
goods covered were included in the list of highly essential items<br>
announced on 30th October, 1947. The Government had hoped that it<br>
would be possible to avoid cancellation of any licences, but, in the light<br>
of the inter-departmental committee's report, it was felt that there was9<br>
wastho alternative but to cancel all outstanding licences not falling<br>
wihnthe above categories. It is estimated that the effect of these<br>
decisions will be to confirm licences to a value of œ A. 35,000,000, ' and to<br>
cancel licences to a value of œ A. 17,000,000.<br>
"" Major items involving dollar expenditure such as newsprint, motor<br>
vehicle chassis, tobacco, petrol and film remittances are being dealt with<br>
separately and were not covered in the general review of import licences.<br>
Further economies in these major items will be inescapable and specific<br>
proposals will he submitted to Cabinet for decision. </p>
<p>12<br>
"" Despite the action already taken and the further action proposed,<br>
our inescapable commitments are so great that the possibilities of<br>
effecting reductions in dollar expenditure durng 1947-48 are limited.<br>
Even when all possible action has been taken it seems probable that<br>
imports from the United States and Canada during 1947-47 will be<br>
about œ A. 90,000,000. However, a marked tapering off in dollar imports<br>
may be expected during the second half of 1947-48 and imports during<br>
the calendar year 1948 from the dollar area will be reduced to a level<br>
bearing a much closer relationship to our current dollar earnings.<br>
The Government appreciates that, to meet cases of special urgency,<br>
some new licences will have to be granted for the importation of goods<br>
from the dollar area during 1947-48. However, a ceiling figure has<br>
been placed on the value of such licences and the inter-departmental<br>
committee has been given ' the responsibility of recommending the<br>
allocation of licences withing the ceiling . figure. The Government is<br>
now considering the basis on which dollar import licences are to be<br>
issued for goods to be imported during 1948-49. It is proposed to<br>
establish quotas for the various classes of goods within a budget ceiling<br>
and the Minister of Trade and Customs ( Senator Courtice) will<br>
announce as soon as possible the procedure to be followed in granting<br>
import licences.<br>
The Government regrets the inconvenience and hardship which<br>
cancellation of import licences and other dollar conservation measures<br>
have caused in industry and commerce. It feels confident, however, that<br>
the Australian people as a whole will support the action taken, since<br>
failure to reduce dollar expenditure would inevitably increase the much<br>
greater hardships at present being endured by the British people.<br>
Britain is at present making sales from its reserves of gold and is<br>
borrowing from the International Monetary Fund to pay for imports<br>
of food and other essential goods and to meet the dollar deficit of other<br>
members of the sterling area. Australia must do what she can to help<br>
by reducing net demands on Britain for dollars to the absolute<br>
minimum."" FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR. S, PRIME MINISTER'S<br>
. STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT.<br>
In Parliament.-On 4th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said--<br>
"" To understand the Government's attitude towards the dollar<br>
shortage, it is necessary to go back to the time when Sir Kingsley Wood<br>
was Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain. For a long time, Britain<br>
had been selling foreign securities to finance the war, and was thus<br>
losing its income from foreign investments. This income had formerly<br>
come to Britain in the form of food and raw materials, and. no doubt,<br>
in the form of luxury items, also. It did not require any one of great<br>
sagacity to forecast that if this process was continued much longer,<br>
economic difficulties must inevitably arise. During the war, and afterwards,<br>
the Australian Government maintained restrictions on the use<br>
of dollars. I realized that the British Government. operating under </p>
<p>43<br>
the Anglo-American Loan Agreement, was bound by certain obligations<br>
which did not apply rigidly to Australia. We have guarded, so far<br>
as we thought reasonable, against the undue expenditure of American<br>
dollars for goods and equipment.<br>
There is nothing very mystifying about the position. It is true<br>
that the situation has deteriorated very rapidly during the last eighteen<br>
months. The loan that Lord Keynes negotiated on behalf of the<br>
British Government with the United States Govermnent was not as<br>
large as the British Government wanted. The terms of the loan were<br>
generous, but some of the conditions attaching to it I regard as very<br>
obnoxious. It was hoped, however, that the loan would be sufficient to<br>
maintain the Empire pool of dollars long enough to allow certain things<br>
to happen. The first was the rehabilitation of British industry, and<br>
the development of the British export trade; the second was the<br>
rehabilitation of Europe, which would have provided a market for<br>
: British goods, and would have supplied other goods in return. This<br>
hope was defeated by the disastrous inflation of prices in the United<br>
States, which meant that the quantity of goods which could h. e bought<br>
out of the loan was much smaller than had been expected. Moreover,<br>
the price of goods bought from Argentina, and other hard currency<br>
rountries, rose in some instances by 150 per cent., and prices generally<br>
increased by 40 per cent. The second factor which helped to defeat<br>
the original plan was that the rehabilitation of Europe has not proceeded<br>
as was expected. For some time, climatic conditions in Britain<br>
were disastrous, a fact which added to that country's troubles. For a<br>
considerable time, more than two million of Britain's men were overseas<br>
on military duty in various parts of the world, and it was not<br>
possible to withdraw them immediately, although that is now being<br>
done as quickly as possible. Those inen were not producing, and some<br>
of themn-tho. e in Germany, Palestine and Egypt-were drawing on<br>
dollars from the American loan for their upkeep.<br>
It is true that we could export to dollar, or hard currency, areas<br>
a quantity of goods and coiiniodities that we are now either using ourselves,<br>
or are sending to Britain, where they are sorely needed. I have<br>
discussed this matter with the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard).<br>
I have gone into it very fully. We could, no doubt, export more goods<br>
to hard currency areas such a. s the Philippines, China, Panama, South<br>
America and to Switzerland. But we must never lose sight of the fact<br>
that, for a number of reasons, we owe a great responsibility and duty<br>
to Britain. One reason is that the British are a great nation with<br>
wonderful traditions. During the last seven or eight years they have<br>
shown a magnificent spirit. They bore the brunt of the catastrophic<br>
war from 1939 until 1945. To-day, they are in most difficult circiunstances.<br>
A second, and very material, reason is that Britain has been<br>
Australia'. greatest customer. Therefore, we cannot lightly brush<br>
aside our duty to Britain. Australia is one of the countries which made<br>
the least economic sacrifice, and suffered least in World War II. Are<br>
we to deny to Britain wheat, butter and other good. s which our kinsfolk </p>
<p>44<br>
urgently need because they can offer us payment only in sterling? If<br>
we decided to withold those goods so that we should not make any<br>
sacrifices, we should increase intensely Britain's economic difficulties.<br>
The Australian Government is not prepared to do that.<br>
Two problems arise. One is whether we should export to the<br>
dollar area certain materials and commodities in short supply here,<br>
which Britain does not particularly require but which we ourselves<br>
badly need for our own industries. In the hard currency countries we<br>
could sell cement, steel, constructional steel, . steel rods and timber.<br>
But if we did so we should accentuate the scarcity of these materials.<br>
One of the great problems now confronting the people of the United<br>
States arises because America has exported such enormous quantities<br>
of goods as to produce a shortage in the domestic market. That has<br>
accentuated the inflationary spiral. Because of the enormous volume<br>
of exports, many goods are in short supply, and, with the abolition of<br>
prices control, the American people are obliged to pay excessive prices<br>
for them. We must examine the problem as realists. We desire to extend<br>
to Britain all possible assistance, while striking a fair balance to ensure<br>
that our own people do not make undue sacriefices. This course is to<br>
be preferred to seizing every opportunity to sell our exports in the hard<br>
currency and dollar area. Britain, which urgently needs these goods,<br>
has been, and will -be, our greatest customer for decades. Are we to<br>
ignore the plight of Britain because some temporary customer requires<br>
these goods and is prepared to pay dollars for them? Are we to<br>
deprive our greatest customer, friend and ally of those goods? We<br>
must weigh all these factors realistically.<br>
The Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice) is deluged with<br>
requests from other countries for Australian goods. Most of these<br>
goods happen to be urgently required on the Australian market. The<br>
International Food Council considers that Australia's exports of food<br>
R hould be allocated in a fair proportion to the needs of the people who<br>
require them. Britain is a party to the International Food Council.<br>
Senator Courtice could readily find markets for our wheat in China,<br>
for which we would receive payment in American dollars, or in<br>
Switzerland, for which we would be paid in Swiss francs, and for other<br>
goods in the Philippines or Panama. If we sold these goods and conmmodities<br>
in China, Switzerland, the Philippines and Panama, the<br>
people of Britain and Australia would not have adequate supplies.<br>
Therefore. we must strike a balance. Senator Courtice has been<br>
examining the subject very closely to ascertain whether we can export<br>
goods without doing an injustice to Britain and disrupting our own<br>
economy There is no mum. bo-jumbo about the dollar shortage. What i.<br>
the real source of the trouble? The value of the goods which the United<br>
States has exported is approximately three times, as much in dollars<br>
s the value of the goods which it has imported. To that situation,<br>
I<br>
I'l </p>
<p>there can be only one answer. This formn of trade must have violent<br>
repercussions. I do not condemn the United States. Had it not been<br>
for the assistance of the United States in World War II., Australia<br>
might have been conquered by the Japanese. When we begin to<br>
examine this problem we discover there are many matters which must<br>
be studied. If the value of the exports of a country are three times<br>
the value of its imports, there can be only one result.<br>
"" The United States * has made great contributions to assist other<br>
countries, and the maintenance of Japan to-day is costing an e normous<br>
sum. America has poured out billions of dollars, and perhaps some<br>
doubt may be expressed as to the wisdom of the way in which the<br>
money was expended. However, this granting of assistance is a tribute<br>
to the American Government, the Department of State and people who<br>
have some appreciation of the enormous problems now confronting the<br>
world. It would be easy for me to say that the only course which will<br>
remedy the situation is for the American people to make the most<br>
magnificent gesture that the world has ever seen. That idea is not<br>
easy to sell to all the American people. When we are situated so far<br>
away from America, it is easy for us to preach about lofty ideals, and<br>
what the United States should do. It is not always easy to convince a<br>
majority of the people of the right policy to adopt in relation to other<br>
countries. That is one of the great difficulties which American statesmen<br>
are facing to-day. I make no criticism of that. It is for the<br>
Americans, as people living in a democracy, to choose the course which<br>
they think fit.<br>
It would not matter whether the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.<br>
Menzies) or any one else was in office at present. He would have to<br>
face the reality that Australia could not get goods from the dollar area<br>
without paying for them. The great industrial barons are not<br>
philanthropists. They do not manufacture motor vehicles, cotton<br>
textiles and tractors with the idea of presenting them to us free of<br>
charge. The conditions attached to the Anglo-A-merican loan contained a<br>
provision for convertibility of sterling balances. India, Egypt, Australia,<br>
Southern Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa had all<br>
accumulated enormous sterling balances in London. They were all in<br>
a position given good seasons such as we are now experiencing, to earn<br>
a great amount of current sterling. That is also true of Argentina, a<br>
country which was exporting goods to Britain and charging very high<br>
prices for them. When the convertibility provision of the Anglo-<br>
American loan commenced to operate, those countries immediately<br>
rushed in to obtain dollars. A certain amount of that sort of thing<br>
was done in Australia. Those who held lecters of credit demanded<br>
dollars, irrespective of the strain placed on the British Tretu; ury, even<br>
though, in some oases, their goods were still on the water. Betweeii the<br>
time when this~ rush hogan and the time when the British Chancellor </p>
<p>had to announce d a r Aol lar euies ismust end, there was an etiormifls<br>
flow of dollars fromi' the 13lritish pool. The dralin was so severe<br>
that it had to be stoiped, despite the provision in the termts of the<br>
Anlglo-Anicrica n loan. Since then, the prices of goods in dollar aS.<br>
and indeed akho in hard currency areas, have continued to rise so tha-t<br>
British couintries are nowv unable to obtain, for-a given amount of doilitn<br>
( urretl,-y, the same quentity of goods as they could obtain previously.<br>
"" The Britiqlh Government has used almost all of the Amierican<br>

It lhas had to draw extensively on those reserves. In adldition, it lias<br>

grold. It istrue that the British Government requested that we should<br>
live wvithin oui-dollar earnings. I told the Treasury in London at tihe<br>
time that that iva an impossible task for Australia.<br>
Last year, despite the restrictions this Government imposed, Australia<br>
had to purchase 100,000,000 Canadian and American dollars from<br>
the depleted Empire pool. This year, even though we have imposed<br>
further restrictions on the use of dollars,_ the situation is still rapidly<br>
deteriorating. Very reasonable supervision has been maintained over<br>
the issuing of import licences for goods that involve dollar expenditure.<br>
hut, owing increased prices and other reasons, we arc still importing<br>

the British pres last week in which a very high tribute was paid to the<br>
co-operation of the Niv; raliaii Government in saving dollars. That </p>
<p>statement declared that, if other countries had done as Britain and<br>
Australia had done, Britain would by now have been much nearer than<br>
it is to the top of the very steep hill to complete economic rehabilitation<br>
which it is climbing.<br>
"" The Government is discussing problems associated with dollar<br>
shortages with the various industries affected so that it may have the<br>
considered views of everybody on the subject. We are anxious to cushion<br>
the impact of restrictions so that industries may he kept operating as<br>
much as possible and so that people employed in them shall suffer as<br>
little as possible.<br>
My final word is that we must guard against the exhaustion of<br>
the British Empire dollar pool. Should the pool reach such a low ebb<br>
that dollars cannot be released to us, then we must sharply cut off<br>
imports of all things that we now hope to purchase with dollars drawn<br>
from it. That would mean a sudden disruption of the national economy.<br>
We want to avoid doing that and to continue to do justice to our own<br>
people and to our great allies the people of Great Britain.""<br>
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS, CABINET<br>
DECISIONS.<br>
On 8th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
""' The statement on the dollar situation tabled in the House of<br>
CRpresentatives on 4th December, 1947, indicated that of the<br>
œ A. 52,000,000 of dollar import licences recalled for review about<br>
œ A. 35,000,000 were to be confirmed and about œ A. 17,000,000 were to<br>
be cancelled. However, major items such as motor chassis and tobacco, involving<br>
heavy dollar expenditure, were not included in the general review of<br>
import licences. Cuts in these major items were made by Cabinet in<br>
September, 1947, but the statement presented to Parliament pointed<br>
out that further economies would be inescapable and that specific<br>
proposals would be submitted to Cabinet for decision at its next<br>
meeting. Afer a full review of the dollar position, Cabinet has now decided<br>
to effect further economies in dollar expenditure on the following<br>
iterrn-:-MOTOR VF\ in'cI. Cu(:'\ ss.-linllmports otf mtor vehicle chassis from North<br>

hiIve alr4: eady beeln umule and any further reduction in dollar expenditure ou<br>
imports , of tobacco leaf cannot therefore be made effective until the financial<br>
year 1948-49. Cabinet decided to reduce importa of American tobacco leaf in<br>
1948-49 by approximately 50 per cent. This will involve a 10 per cent. reduction<br>
in releases for consumption as from 1st January, 1948, combined with a reduction<br>
in uresent stock holdings. I </p>
<p>48<br>
NEWSPRINT FOR THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY.-Cabinet approved a reduction<br>
in total newsprint consumption ( Australian and imported) to 90,000 tons per<br>
annum as from 1st January, 1948. This makes the average cut on pre-war<br>
consumption 51 per cent.<br>
PETROL.-Cabinet decided to effect a further 10 per cent. reduction in total<br>
licensed gallonage. The cut will be applied uniformly to all classes of<br>
consumers. FILM REMrTTANCES.-Under decisions previously announced the film companies<br>
are permitted to remit to their principals in the United States 70 per<br>
cent. of the amount of their remittances in the base year ( 1946). Cabinet<br>
decided that as from 1st January, 1948, remittances should be limited to 50 per<br>
cent. of the base year quota, earnings in excess of that figure to be retained in<br>
Australia. "" After allowing for the effect of these decisions and the decisions<br>
announced earlier by the Government, total imports from the United<br>
I States and Canada in 1947-48 will still be about œ A. 90,000,000, compared<br>
with actual imports in 1946-47 of just over œ A. 60,000,000. It is<br>
anticipated, however, that the measures taken by the Government will<br>
reduce the rate of importation in the calendar year 1948 to one which<br>
is practicable in the light of the assessment of the dollar situation at<br>
present available.<br>
"" Cabinet discussed the possibility of reducing the size of Australia's<br>
dollar deficit by adopting measures to increase Australian exports to<br>
the dollar area. It was recognized that the possibilities were limited<br>
because of existing commitments to Britain and because many of the<br>
items which could be sold for dollars are in short supply in Australia.<br>
The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) was<br>
authorized to take. steps within the framework of existing export<br>
controls to divert a greater proportion of Australian produced goods to<br>
dollar export markets. Any measures adopted will be taken after consultation<br>
with other interested Commonwealth departments and with<br>
the industries affected.""<br>

MIGRATION.<br>
GOVERNMENT POLICY-MINISTER'S STATEMENT,<br>
NOVEMBER, 1947.<br>
In Parliament.-On 28th November, 1947, the Minister for Immigration<br>
( Mr. Calwell) said-<br>
I am able to inform the House that, when 1947-the first full year<br>
of large-scale, planned immigration-has run. its course, Australia will<br>
have received 30,000 permanent arrivals, in spite of the desperate postwar<br>
shipping shortage, which is afflicting Britain so grievously, which<br>
i all nations suffer in common and which is one of the main obstacles to<br>
the achievement of our target figure of 70,000 immigrants a year.<br>
These 30,000 new arrivals represent all of the three main streams of<br>
immigrants-British, American and European-on which Australia<br>
must rely for the new life blood it so urgently needs.<br>
i f </p>
<p>I.,<br>
49<br>
In Britain to-day over 400,000 people are anxious to settle in<br>
Australia. Of the 30,000 permanent new arrivals we shall have gained<br>
by the end of 1947, the vast majority will be from Britain.<br>
It is not a healthy condition to have an over-populated Britain<br>
and under-populated dominions, and conversely it is mutually beneficial<br>
to have all the Dominions of the British Commonwealth increasing in<br>
strength from year to year. Britain therefore must help Australia so<br>
that Australia may help Britain and the Blritish Commonwealth of<br>
Nations. I hope that the British authorities will -understand our need<br>
as we press for more and more ships to carry more and more people to<br>
this country. We have no wish to embarrass the British Government by<br>
seeking large numbers of specialists who are in short supply. Aus<br>
tralia's man-power requirements cover such a wide range in every field<br>
of primary, secondary and tertiary industry that we are not obliged to<br>
seek workers for only a few particular occupations. We can, therefore,<br>
readily absorb a cross-section of British people without detriment to<br>
Britain's economic structure but with material advantage to both<br>
countries. We have always been prepared to accept this fair crosssection.<br>
The Government realizes that the provision of Shipping is the<br>
key to immigration plans and has examined every possibility of<br>
obtaining additional transport for British migrants. The results will<br>
be demonstrated in 1948 when the migrant lift will be substantially<br>
greater than has been possible in 1947. The shipping position is one<br>
which will show progressive improvement over the next two or three<br>
years, even thought that improvement is not as fast as we would like.<br>
Nevertheless, I am confident that we shall obtain transport for at least<br>
25.000 free and assisted passage British migrants in 1948. This number<br>
is, of course, additional to the total of full fare paying passengers.<br>
"" During the war years, many thousands of American servicemen<br>
visited Australia. Already, 10,000 applications have been received in<br>
the United States, repres'e'nting about 20,000 potential migrants. To<br>
deal with these applications and to select migrants wh-o will be of the<br>
g4reatest benefit to our economy, trained immigration officers with knowledge<br>
of Australian industrial requirements have been attached to the<br>
Austialian Consulates-General at New York and San Francisco. The<br>
first party of 70 United States migrants to benefit from the scheme<br>
arrived in Australia in September, 1947, and further parties have<br>
brought the total to 206. While this is a useful start, it is obvious that<br>
wve will not increase our population by any substantial number while<br>
wec depend on the very limuited passenger shipping at present plying<br>
between America and Australia. I took action while in America<br>
recently to institute negotiations with the Matson Line for two additional<br>
vessels to be put on the San Francisco-Sydney run with the aid<br>
of a subsidy by the Commonwealth Government against loss on<br>
operation. These negotiations are still proceeding, -and if rnutna-ily </p>
<p>satisfactory arrangements can be made, each ship will be able to carry<br>
3,900 United States migrants a year, based on 650 passengers a voyage,<br>
and a round voyage every two months.<br>
To-day, there are in Germany some 850,000 displaced persons,<br>
mainly of Baltic, Polish and Yugo-Slav origin. Their occupations<br>
include agriculturalists, hospital workers, shipwrights, light manufacturing<br>
workers, building workers, engineers, dentists, doctors and other<br>
professional men. These persons, whose normal standards of living<br>
have been compatible with our own, and who even now do not, in a large<br>
proportion of cases, consist of depressed classes, represent an ideal<br>
source of migrants who will fit smoothly into our way of life and who<br>
will help to meet Australia's labour shortages in the fields of industry<br>
and agriculture. Initially it was decided that 12,000 displaced persons<br>
should be brought to Australia annually under the agreement, but the<br>
Commonwealth is willing to increase this number to 20,000 a year. To<br>
implement this agreement, an Australian selection team, including<br>
doctors, has been appointed, and operates under the aegis of the head<br>
of the Australian Military Mission at Berlin. Migrants are selected<br>
on the basis of their suitability for employment and absorption into<br>
our Australian community.<br>
The Commonwealth Government has entered into an agreement<br>
with ! he Netherlands Emigration Foundation for the migration to<br>
Australia of Dutch national.. Initially, it is proposed to bring to<br>
Australia farm workers at the rate of 50 per month. When the employment<br>
situation in Holland permits, consideration will he given to the<br>
extension of the scheme to other categories of workers.<br>
"" During 1946. the record nimrber of 7,126 certificates of naturalization<br>
was issued to persons of 41 different nationalities. For the first<br>
half of 1947, 1,654 certificates were issued comprising 33 different<br>
nationalities. In previous years, the number of certificates issued rarely<br>
exceeded 1,500 in any one year. The granting of naturalization is one<br>
of the most effective means of facilitating the assimilntion of the non-<br>
SBritish members of our population.<br>
"" I have said that the present procedure connected with the taking<br>
II of the Oath of Allegiance by applicants for naturalization left much<br>
to be desired. The Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council<br>
considered this matter, and has recommended that the administration<br>
of the oath should be conducted in open court, accompanied by an<br>
appropriate and dignified induction ceremony, which should include<br>
the delivery of an address to the applicants by the presiding judge or<br>
magistrate An appropriate form of oath of allegiance, and suitable<br>
arrangements for induction ceremonies are now under consideration.<br>
1 The council has also recommended that the Department of Immigration<br>
should issue a pamphlet for the guidance of prospective citizens, which<br>
would describe to them in simple language our historical background,<br>
i 1 </p>
<p>51<br>
our mode of government and the responsibilities and privileges of<br>
Australian citizenship. I have approved this recommendation and the<br>
preparation of the pamphlet is now in hand as part of a campaign<br>
designed accelerate the assimilation of the alien newcomers.,""<br>
CIVIL AVIATION.<br>
INTERNAL ROUITES--GOVERNMENT CONTROL, AIRIINES<br>
COMMISSION ACT, AMENDING BILL.<br>
In Parliament.-On 3rd December, 1947, the Minister for Air<br>
( Mr. Drakeford) introduced the Australian National Airlines Bill.<br>
Mr. Drakeford said-<br>
"" The primary purpose of this bill is to authorize the Australian<br>
National Airlines Commission to undertake and develop intra-state air<br>
services. Under the existing act, the commission may engage in intrastate<br>
services only to the extent that such services are incidental to<br>
the safe, efficient and economical operation of interstate territorial and<br>
international services. As one step towards the development of intrastate<br>
services, it is proposed that section 19 be amplified so as to<br>
authorize expressly the transport of mail within any State. While<br>
section 22 of the existing act refers to the promotion of the carriage<br>
of mails this section is not expressly linked with section 19. The<br>
Commonwealth Parliament has unquestionable power to provide air<br>
transport, whether interstate or intra-state, for postal purposes, and it<br>
is now considered desirable that the commission should be clearly<br>
authorized to carry mails intra-state so as to be able to implement any<br>
agreement for the carriage of mails authorized under section 22. The<br>
commission will then be able to carry passengers and freight within<br>
any State as incidental to the postal service, provided that the primary<br>
purpose of a particular service is the carriage of mail.<br>
"" It is proposed that provision be made for the adoption of the<br>
powers in relation to air transport referred to the Commonwealth in<br>
1943 under the Commonwealth Powers Acts of the various States<br>
except Victoria and Tasmania. Queensland and New South Wales have<br>
referred to this Parliament the matter of air transport and South<br>
Australia and Western Australia the matter of the regulation of air<br>
transport. These references remain effective and cannot be revoked by<br>
ordinary legislative process until 2nd September, 1950, so that until<br>
that date the Commonwealth Parliament may make laws in respect of<br>
air transport within the States which have made the references. As<br>
yet these special and additional powers referred by the States have not<br>
been invoked.<br>
"" During the recent conference of Commonwealth and State<br>
Ministers, the Premier of Queensland indicated that his Government<br>
desired the Commonwealth to authorize the commission to establish and<br>
operate intra-state services in Queensland on condition that the commission<br>
pays the same rate of tax as that imposed by that State on<br>
privately operated airlines. The Government considers that it will be i </p>
<p>of direct benefit, not only to Queensland, but to the Commonwealth as a<br>
whole, if the commission develops intra-state services within Queensland<br>
and other States, even though it is possible that these services, in view of<br>
their developmental nature, may he unprofitable in the beginning. It<br>
has decided to accept the invitation of the Queensland Government to<br>
engage in this new sphere of air service operations.<br>
The provision in the bill implementing State references authorizes<br>
the establishment, maintenance and operation of air services within any<br>
State which has made the necessary references so that fresh legislation<br>
will not be necessary as and when it is decided to take advantage of the<br>
reference in any particular State. Although there is no legal necessity<br>
to impose any limitation, the bill provides that the commission shall<br>
not establish any service unless the Premier of the State in which the<br>
service is to be established has notified the Prime Minister in writing<br>
that he consents to the establishment of the service. This will ensure<br>
that the powers which have already been referred by four States will<br>
not be exercised without the express cons-ent of the States concerned.<br>
In addition, a further sub-clause imposes an obligation on the commission<br>
to pay from time to time amounts equivalent to the licence fees<br>
which would be payable under the law of the State if the service were<br>
operated by a person other than the commission. This provision has<br>
the effect of requiring the commission to pay the same licence-fees as<br>
private operators and meets the condition stipulated by the Premier<br>
of Queensland at the Premiers' Conference.<br>
"" Another clause amends section 48 which provides that the commission<br>
must give 30 days' notice of intention to establish a service.<br>
territorial airline licences applied for by Trans-Australia Airlines in<br>
circumstances which will bring into operation section 46 of the act and<br>
thereby render inoperative any airline licence held by any other person<br>
by reason of the fact that the commission is providing an adequate<br>
service. The remaining clauses are mainly concerned with matters of drafting<br>
and in particular repeal those sections of the act declared invalid<br>
by the High Court in the Australian National Airways case.""<br>

CHRISTMAS CARDS.<br>
On 5th December, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>

items regarded as non-essential, there will be no issue of Christmas<br>
cards by Commonwealth administrations for 1947.""<br>

<p>L INCOME TAX.<br>
UNIFORM TAXATION-REIMBURSEMENT TO STATES,<br>
BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliamnt. v-Qn 9th October, 1947, the Prima Minister ( Mr.<br>
Chifley) introduced the States Grants ( Tax Reimbursement) Bill. Mr.<br>
Chifley said-<br>
The object of this bill is to provide for the payment of an additional<br>
tax reimbursement grant to the States under the uniform tax plan.<br>
Under the 1946 act, a revised basis of tax reimbursement grants came<br>
into operation as from 1st July, 1946. Main provisions of that act<br>
were-Aggregate grant in 1946-47 and 1947-48 to be œ 40,000,000, distributed among<br>
the States in Accordance with the first sche~ dule of the act.<br>
-In 1948-49 and subsequent years, the aggregate grant to be increased in<br>
accordance with the formula, which takes account of the variations in the States,<br>
jpopulations, and one half of the percentage increase, if any, in the level of<br>
average wages per person employed, over the level in 19441-47.<br>
In 1948-49 and subsequent years, the distribution of the aggregate grant<br>
aniong the States to be varied to an increasing degree in accordance with the<br>
adjusted populations of the States.<br>
The gralit to each State in any year to be not less than that received in<br>
1946-47.<br>
"" At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in<br>
August, 1947, the Premiers maintained that the aggregate grant of<br>
œ 4,000,000 would be insufficient to enable them to balance their budgets<br>
in 1947-48. It is clear that there has been a deterioration of State<br>
finances. Mainly because of the success of the Commonwealth Government's<br>
low interest rate policy, State debt charges-which constitute a<br>
major item of State expenditures-have in the aggregate not increased<br>
over the 1938-39 level. In the field of administration and social services,<br>
however, State expenditures are showing an unusually rapid increase,<br>
partly because of the impact of rising costs and prices.<br>
o "" The Commonwealth Government does not desire to upset the basis<br>
ofreimbursement provided for in the 1946 act, which, in the absence of<br>
a major change in the relations between the Commonwealth and any<br>
State or States having an effect on the finances ot a -State or -States, was<br>
to operate for at least seven years. On this basis, the State governments<br>
are, in effect, guaranteed the reimbursement provided for in the act,<br>
irrespective of fluctuations in the financial position of the * Commonwealth.<br>
Accordingly, the Government proposes that the States Grants<br>
( Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946 shall continue in operation, with the<br>
addition of a section to provide for-<br>

BARLEY.<br>
STABILIZATION PLAN-CONTINUANCE.<br>
On 9th October, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)<br>
announced that the Commonwealth Government would extend barley<br>
marketing regulations to enable the incoming crop to be marketed by<br>
the Australian Barley Board as in previous seasons, on a Commonwealth<br>
basis, with a guaranteed minimum price. Urgent requests had been<br>
made by the Victorian and South Australian Governments and growers'<br>
organizations that that would be done.<br>
On 30th Octobcr, 1947, Mr. Pollard announced that the Australian<br>
Barley Board would handle and market oats of all grades under voluntary<br>
pool with a minimum guarantee from the Government, and<br>
would be the sole exporter of oats. The arrangement would apply in<br>
all States, but growers would be free to sell on the open market. The<br>
Government guarantee of 3s. 3d. a bushel on rails at growers' sidings,<br>
plus an extra 3d. a bushel to off-set higher cost of bags, would be payable,<br>
but growers would not be permitted to rail oats until advised by the<br>
board. ( For earlier references, please see No. 117, page 44.)<br>
No. 8 POOL-FOURTH ADVANCE.<br>
On 28th October, 1947, Mr. Pollard announced that a fourth advance<br>
of 9d. a bushel for malting grades and 3d. a bushel for feed grades had<br>
been approved on 1946-47 crop barley in No. 8 pool. The advance<br>
brought payments to growers to 7s. 3d. a bushel less freight for 2-row<br>
malting barley, and 3s. 8d. less freight for 6-row feed grade.<br>
REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY.<br>
On 9th October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
In accordance with the approval given by the King in respect of<br>
the observance this year of Remembrance Sunday in Britain, the Commonwealth<br>
Government proposes that the usual arrangements be made </p>
<p>in Australia for the commemoration of Remembrance Day on 9th<br>
November, 1947, as a Day of Remembrance for those who gave their<br>
lives both in World War I. and World War II.<br>
WHEAT POOLS PAYMENTS.<br>
No. 11 POOLr-FIRST ADVANCE.<br>
On 10th October, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)<br>
announced that the first advance to growers for No. 11 wheat pool would<br>
be 4s. 6d. a bushel net for bulk wheat and 5s. a bushel net for bagged<br>
wheat-the highest first advance for any pool.<br>
No. 10 POOL-THIRD ADVANCE.<br>
On 30th October, 1947, Mr. Pollard announced that a third advance<br>
of Is. a bushel had been approved for No. 10 pool. The advance would<br>
bring the amounts to 6s. 7d. for bulk and 6s. 10d. for bagged. less freight.<br>
PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br>
DAIRY INDUSTRY-ADVISORY COMMITTEE, REPORT.<br>
On 13th October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) announced<br>
that the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee which had made a<br>
survey of farm costs of production of butter, cheese and processed milk<br>
products had, in advance of its final report, submitted recommendations<br>
to the Government. It had been decided that the overall -basic return to<br>
the farmer at the factory door would be 2s. per lb. commercial butter<br>
basis-an increase of 41d. per lb. on the present recognized cost of production<br>
of Is. 7Id. per lb. to the dairy farmer and, in accordance with<br>
the Government's understanding with the industry, would be retrospective<br>
to 1st April, 1947.<br>
The Government had decided to guarantee a price to the industry<br>
on total production of the products mentioned for five years from 1st<br>
April, 1947. The basic return to the farmer of 2s. per lb. commercial<br>
butter would be subject to variation up or down in accordance with<br>
demonstrated movements in cost factors. There would be a review of<br>
cost factors between 1s, April and 15th June in each year during the<br>
five years, following which any necessary adjustmnents of the basic price<br>
now determined would be made as from 1st July of the year under<br>
reniew. As a result of the Government's decision, increases in the retail<br>
prices of butter, cheese and associated milk products would be necessary<br>
and while the existing subsidy payments of about œ 4,500,000 a year<br>
would be continued, it had yet to determine the extent to which the whole<br>
or part of the increased prices would be passed on to the consumer. It<br>
was estimated that from 1st April, 1947, until such time as it was<br>
possible to adjust retail prices to the consuming public the Commonwealth<br>
Government would pay a further subsidy of about œ E2,000,000. </p>
<p>The Government had approved an annual grant of an amount not<br>
exceeding œ 250,000 for five years commencing 1st January, 1948, to<br>
promote improved farm practices in the dairy industry. Plans would<br>
be drawn up by the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) in consultation<br>
with representatives of the industry and State Ministers of<br>
Agriculture. ( For earlier references, please see No. 115, page 33; No. 122, page 18.)<br>
DAIRY INDUSTRY-CONTROL, BOARD CHAIRMAN.<br>
On 4th November, 1947, Mr. Pollard announced that the president<br>
of the Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation ( Mr. G. C. Howey) had<br>
been appointed chairman of the Australian Dairy Produce Board,<br>
re-constituted under recent legislation.<br>

EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-UNITED KINGDOM MISSION.<br>
On 17th October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The Australian Government considers it desirable that Britain<br>
should send a small expert mission to Australia to continue exploratory<br>
discussions commenced at London between representatives of the two<br>
Governments, regarding the production of larger quantities of food in<br>
Australia, so that greater supplies will be available for export to the<br>
British people.<br>
This view is being conveyed to the British Government through the<br>
Australian High Commissioner at London ( Mr. Beasley). He will<br>
express the opinion, already known to : be acceptable to the British<br>
Government, that such a mission will become familiar with technical and<br>
other problems associated with particular primary industries, and secure<br>
a clearer appreciation of action already being taken to stimulate<br>
production. The Australian Government will co-operate enthusiastically in a<br>
project to further increase output of those foods desired by Britain<br>
which can be produced on a commercial scale here, and or which markets<br>
for a reasonable term ahead are assured. This will necessarily include<br>
extensions of existing long-term contracts, and the negotiation of others<br>
-exemplified in preliminary discussions on wheat with Lord Addison<br>
when he was in Australia.<br>
Australia has already been able to increase direct exports to Britain<br>
since the war ended, and to provide food for British Empire countries<br>
in the Pacific and elsewhere. The latter has, no doubt, relieved pressure<br>
on Britain's other supply sources. Australia's efforts will be continued<br>
and, no doubt, can be augmented with direct aid from Britain. Meii<br>
and machines are among urgent requirements to stimulate production<br>
The proposed mission of experts to Australia will have an opportunity<br>
for discussion with Australian agricultural experts, and when<br>
proposals are matured it can be anticipated that their guidance will be<br>
a major contribution in developments </p>

EXPORT. S TO BRITAIN-BUTTER.<br>
On 5th November, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that total exports of<br>
butter during 1946-47 were 133,642,282 lb. of which 116,640,028 lb.<br>
went to Britain. Excepting for a small quantity, Australian butter was<br>
shipped either to or at the direction of the British Ministry of Food and<br>
in accordance with International Emergency Food Council allocations.<br>
( For earlier references, please see No. 115, page 32.)<br>
RURAL PRODUCTION.<br>
On 19th Oct6ber, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-<br>
Gross value of rural production in Australia for 1947-48 has been<br>
estimated at œ 447,000,000 compared with the estimated value of<br>
œ 379,000,000 for 1946-47 and the average annual value for the five<br>
pre-war years ended 1938-39 of œ 211,000,000. The current year's<br>
estimate is about 18 per cent. higher than 1946-47, and considerably<br>
more than double the pre-war figure.<br>
Of the estimated total, agricultural industries are expected to<br>
contribute œ 192,000,000, pastoral industries œ 168,000,000 and dairy<br>
and farmyard industries œ 87,000,000, of which dairy and pig products<br>
represent œ 60,000,000. The estimated figures for 1946-47 are<br>
œ 139,000,000, œ 159,000,000 and œ 81,000,000 respectively.<br>
Expressed in terms of percentages, compared with the average<br>
figures for the pre-war five year period ended 1938-39, increases in the<br>
estimated value of rural production for the current period are-<br>
Wheat.-More than 300 per cent. increase in value and about 29 per cent<br>
incrpase in volume.<br>
Wool.-About 90 per cent. increase inlva lue, but about 8 per cent. decrease in<br>
volume. Meats ( except pig-meats).-About 133 per cent. increase in value; 9 per cent.<br>
increase in number of sheep and lambs slaughtered, but 4 per cent. fewer beef<br>
cattle and calves.<br>
Dairy Products ( including pig-meats).-About 112 per cent. in value, but<br>
per cent. decrease in total milk produced and 16 per cent. decrease in the<br>
number of pigs slaughtered.<br>
"" Wool, estimated to return œ 96,000,000, and wheat, at œ 93,000,000,<br>
are expected to contribute 42 per cent. of the estimated gross return""<br>
SUGAR-AGREEMENT, BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 23rd October, the Minister for Customs<br>
( Senator Courtice) introduced the Sugar Agreement Bill. Senator<br>
Courtice said-<br>
This bill is intended to approve the supplementary sugar agreement<br>
made on 17th October, 1947, between the Commonwealth Government<br>
and the Queensland Government. Under that agreement the<br>
governments agreed to amend the present sugar agrement to provide for<br>
an increase of œ 4 2s. 8d. a ton in the wholesale price of refined sugar of<br>
la grade, and for the prices of sugar of other grades at present fixed by </p>
<p>the Sugar Agreement Act, to be increased comnmensurately. Comparison<br>
of the new maximum prices with the present ones is supplied in the<br>
following table Present Price. New Price.<br>

will be to raise the retail price of refined sugar by Ad. per lb. The new<br>
retail price in capitdl cities will be 4jd.<br>
When the present agreement was signed in October, 1945, the Australian<br>
Government gave an assurance to the sugar industry that, if<br>
during the currency of the agreement, cost levels increased substantially,<br>
it would be prepared to consider instituting an inquiry into the position<br>
of the industry. The Government has become increasingly aware of the<br>
difficulties which the industry had to face during the war years and since,<br>
and it is now convinced that the urgency of the industry's need for<br>
assistance is such that immediate action must be taken to provide a<br>
stimulus to the industry [ The bill was passed.<br>

BANKING CONTROL.<br>
LEGISLATION-NATIONALIZATION, BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 15th October, 1947, the Prime ' Minister ( Mr.*<br>
Chifley) introduced the Banking Bill 1947. Mr. Chifley said-<br>
"" eThe purpose of this bill is to empower the Commonwealth Bank to<br>
take over the banking business at present conducted in Australia by<br>
private banks. ' State banks and savings banks will not be affected. </p>
<p>9<br>
It will be the responsibility of the Commnonwea lth Bank under this<br>
legislation-To provide, in accordance with the conditions of normal banking business,<br>
adequate banking facilities for any State or person requiring them;<br>
To conduct its business without discrimination.<br>
To observe, except as otherwise required by law, the practices and usages<br>
customary among bankers and, in particular, to maintain strict secrecy within<br>
the law as to the affairs and dealings of its customers.<br>
The bill also envisages the development, under public ownership,<br>
of a comprehensive banking service that will strengthen and assist the<br>
growth of the Australian economy and provide facilities adequate to its<br>
rapidly expanding and changing needs.<br>
"" I hardly need argue the importance of money and credit in a<br>
modern economic system. As the means by which resources are brought<br>
together in production, goods are bought and sold, and prices, wages,<br>
contracts and debts are determined, it plays a part as vital to the<br>
economic body as the blood-stream to the human body. No single factorcan<br>
do more to influence the welfare and progress of a community thanthe<br>
management of the volume and flow of money. Mismanagement of<br>
money, on the other hand, has contributed to the greatest economicdisasters<br>
of modern times-booms and slumps, mass unemployment,<br>
waste of resources, industrial unrest and social misery. Because these<br>
facts are recognized, there is very wide agreement to-day as to the<br>
puirposes which a monetary and banking system should serve in a modern<br>
economy. In that connexion I quote the views expressed in 1937 in the<br>
Report of the Royal Comm ission on Monetary and Banking Systems in<br>
Australia-The general objective of an economic system for Australia should be to<br>
achieve the best use of our productive resources, both present and future. This<br>
mneans. the fullest possible employment of people and resources under conditions<br>
that will provide the highest standard of living. It means, too, the reduction of<br>
the monetary and banking system is an integral fluctuation in general economic<br>
activity. Since part of the economic system, its objective will be to assist with<br>
all the means at its disposal in achieving these ends. ( Para. 616.)<br>
Those views as to the place and functions of money and banking in<br>
Australia were subscribed to by all members of the commission, even<br>
though there was some difference of opinion as to ways of achieving<br>
them. The Labour party has maintained for many years that, since the<br>
influence of money is so great, the entire monetary and banking system<br>
should be controlled by public authorities responsible through the Government<br>
and Parliament to the nation. On this principle the Labour<br>
party has held further that since private banks are conducted primarily<br>
for profit and therefore follow policies which in important respects run<br>
counter to the public interest, their business should be transferred to<br>
public ownership. For this view the strongest reasons can be stated.<br>
In the absence of control, private banks can expand or contract the<br>
volume of their lending and so vary within wide limits the supply of<br>
money available to the public. They can also determine when arid<br>
where they will lend and on what terms; and in these operations they </p>
<p>are guided primarily by the interests of those who own and control<br>
them. Whatever regard they may claim to pay to the wider concerns<br>
of the nation, their policies are dictated in the last resort by the desire<br>
to make profits and to secure the value of their own assets. Experienet'<br>
of the past has been that private banks increased their lending in good<br>
times and contracted it in bad times, lent always where the profits<br>
seemed largest and most assured, and charged the highest rates they<br>
could obtain for their loans and general services.<br>
"" Since trading banks have handled practically all commercial<br>
lending within Australia, their influence on the state of business has<br>
been enormous-indeed dominating. Moreover, the number of banks<br>
has been progressively reduced through amalgamations, of which twelve<br>
have been carried through since 1917. Two more were announced this<br>
year and had they been completed the number of major private trading<br>
banks in Australia would have been reduced to seven. By this means<br>
the great power of private banking in Australia has become concentrated<br>
in the hands of boards of directors comprising a relatively few men<br>
who are responsible for the exercise of their powers not to the nation<br>
but only to a limited number of people, some here nd some abroad, who<br>
have invested money in bank shares.<br>
Time and again the policies of the private banks have run counter<br>
to national needs for steady growth and high levels of employment. To<br>
go some years back it is correct to say that the banks fed the boom and<br>
promoted unsound development in the ' twenties. When the depression<br>
came the banks as a whole restricted new lending and. called in advances.<br>
Between December, 1929, and March, 1932, their advances fell by<br>
approximately œ 45,000,000. The effect of this was to accentuate the<br>
contraction of business and the unemployment of those years. They<br>
helped but little in recovery during the ' thirties, waiting rather for<br>
improvement to come from other sources instead of taking the initiative<br>
and helping to promote recovery. They followed these courses because<br>
it seemed best and safest from the standpoint of their own interests.<br>
"" Labour policy on banking has envisaged that, together with the<br>
elimination of private banking, the Commonwealth Bank would be<br>
strengthened to give it adequate control of monetary and credit conditions<br>
within Australia and its services would be extended to meet the<br>
needs of all sections of the people. The Labour party has in particuluar<br>
advocated the reduction of interet rates which, in the absence of control,<br>
were maintained at excessively high levels.<br>
"" The Commonwealth Bank was established in 1911 by the Labour<br>
Government as a national bank, intended primarily to compete with the<br>
private banks on their own ground and break the monopoly they held<br>
over the business of banking in Australia. Despite bitter opposition<br>
from private interests and many prophecies of failure, the Commonwealth<br>
Bank rendered great service to the nation and grew rapidly<br>
during World War I. and the succeeding years. In 1924, however, the<br>
Bruce-Page Government reconstituted the bank and placed it under a </p>
<p>board comprised predominantly of representatives of private industry<br>
and commerce. This board was mainly interested in turning the Commonwealth<br>
Bank into a bankers' bank and its policy was to forbid the<br>
bank from competing actively with the private banks for general banking<br>
business, thus restricting its expansion and defeating the key<br>
purpose for which the bank had been established. That fact was clearly<br>
demons: rated in evidence before the banking commission. The late<br>
Sir Ernest Riddle, who was then Governor of the bank, stated that even<br>
if the bank had funds available over and above those deposited with it<br>
by the trading banks it would not use those funds for advances to people<br>
who wanted to transfer their accounts from trading banks to the Commonwealth<br>
Bank. That kind of situation prevailed until the Labour<br>
Government took office in 1941. Moreover, the Commonwealth Bank<br>
Board, as constituted by the Bruce-Page Government, aligned itself with<br>
the private banks during the crisis of the early ' thirties in attempting<br>
to force on the Government a policy of monetary deflation and curtailment<br>
of wages and social service payments. That policy was stated in<br>
the following extract from a letter addressed by the chairman of the<br>
Bank Board ( Sir Robert Gibson) to the then Treasurer ( Mr. Theodore)<br>
on 12th February, 1931, which read-<br>
Subject to adequate and equitable reductions in all wages, salaries, and<br>
allowances, pensions, social benefits of all kinds, interest and other factors which<br>
affect the cost of living. the Commonwealth Bank Board will actively co-operate<br>
with the trading banks and the governments of Australia in sustaining industry<br>
and restoring employment.<br>
Thus during a critical time in Australia's history the bank was<br>
used by reactionary interests for a purpose directly opposed to the<br>
welfare of the Australian people and in opposition to the will of the<br>
Government of the day.<br>
In spite of conservative management under a board for many years,<br>
the Commonwealth Bank, including the Commonwealth Savings Bank,<br>
has made remarkable headway. At 30th June, 1947, it had 377 branches<br>
spread throughout Australia, as well as branches in Papua, New Guinea<br>
and in London. Total employees exceeded 9,000 and total assets, apart<br>
from those held in respect of deposits of the private banks, were almost<br>
œ 900,000,000. It has nearly 4,000,000 accounts and is unique among<br>
the banks of the world in that it provides comprehensive banking facilities<br>
for business and personal needs through its General Bank, Savings<br>
Bank, Mortgage Bank, Rural Credits, Industrial Finance and Housing<br>
Departments. In both wars the bank made advances against primary<br>
commodities to enable producers to be paid promptly despite serious<br>
delays in sea-borne trade. These advances exceeded œ 350,000,000 during<br>
the six years of the last war. In another field the bank has administered<br>
controls over banking, interest rates, the note issue, foreign exchange<br>
and gold and has developed the full functions of a central bank. In all,<br>
the record of the Commonwealth Bank stands as a great justification of<br>
publicly-owned banking and demonstrates beyond question that a public<br>
banking institution is capable of being highly efficient, progressive and </p>
<p>adaptable. In another respect also the bank has largely fulfilled the<br>
intentions of its founders that it should be a bank for the people.<br>
Together with its associated institution, the Commonwealth Savings<br>
Bank, it has become pre-eminently the bank for the average man and<br>
woman. To-day it has a far greater number of depositors than the<br>
whole of the private banks taken together. At April, 1947, the number<br>
of deposit accounts with the Commonwealth Bank and Commonwealth<br>
Savings Bank was about 3,800,000, whereas the number of deposit<br>
accounts with the trading banks was approximately 1,250,000.<br>
"" Assisted by the existence of the Commonwealth Bank, the Labour<br>
Government has been able to make notable progress in carrying out its<br>
policy of lower interest rates. After World War I. the interest rate on<br>
government loans reached as high as 64 per cent. At the outbreak of<br>
World War II., the rate for long-term government loans was almost<br>
4 per cent. It is now 34 per cent. The treasury-bill rate is now 1 per<br>
cent., as compared with a rate of 6 per cent. in 1930. The maximum<br>
overdraft rate has been restricted to 44 per cent., as compared with rates<br>
of 6 per cent. and higher some years ago. Substantial reductions have<br>
also been made in the rates at which semi-governmental bodies are able<br>
to borrow, and in many other rates.<br>
The experience of the war years emphasized the vital importance<br>
of public control of the banking system. Through governmental expenditure<br>
for war purposes, the liquid resources of the trading banksand<br>
hence their capacity to expand credit-increased rapidly. To<br>
prevent ' secondary inflation arising from such as expansion of credit.<br>
even the then Treasurer ( Mr. Fadden) felt that some action was<br>
necessary, and, in 1941, he obtained an undertaking from the private<br>
banks that they would inform the Commonwealth Bank of the amount<br>
of surplus investible funds they held from time to time and would<br>
deposit with the Commonwealth Bank such amounts as were determined<br>
by that hank. On assuming office in November, 1941, the Labour Government<br>
carefully examined the arrangements made by the previous<br>
Government and decided that it was necessary to introduce National<br>
Security ( War-time Banking Control) Regulations. These regulations<br>
greatly strengthened and increased in scope the arrangements agreed to<br>
by the previous Government. They also ensured that the private banks<br>
would not make unreasonable profits out of the war and implemented<br>
certain recommendations of the Banking Commission.<br>
"" In the light of experience gained in the administration of these<br>
regulations, the Government decided, in 1945, that the main principles<br>
on which they were based should be embodied in substantive legislation.<br>
At the same time the Government decided to reconstitute the Commonwalth<br>
Bank and to assume greater powers over banking policy. The<br>
main objects of the system of control provided by this legislation were-<br>
To strengthen the central banking functions of the Commonwealth Bank,<br>
especially by providing for the co-ordination of banking policy under the direc-<br>
ø tion of the Commonwealth Bank; control through the special account system </p>
<p>of the volume of credit in circulation: control of bank interest rates and bank<br>
advance policy; and the mobilization and control of the foreign exchange and<br>
gold resources of the Australian economy.<br>
To ensure that the financial policy of the Commonwealth Bank would be in<br>
harmony with the general economic and financial policy of the Government and<br>
in the interests of the people of Australia.<br>
To reserve to publicly-owned and controlled banks the banking business of<br>
governments and governmental authorities.<br>
To safeguard the depositors of the banks against loss of their deposits.<br>
The Bank Board was abolished and management of the bank was<br>
entrusted to the Governor, assisted by an advisory council.<br>
This legislation was very strongly opposed by the trading banks,<br>
by some sections of the business community and by the Opposition<br>
parties. It was said that the legislation would hand over the banking<br>
system to political control, that it was nationalization on the cheap<br>
and that it would open the way to the general socialization of industry<br>
by indirect means. In his second-reading speech on the legislation, the<br>
Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Menzies) made a pledge that, if he and<br>
his colleagues were returned to office, they would restore the former<br>
method of control of the Commonwealth Bank by a board and would<br>
hold themselves obliged instantly to review the working of the<br>
legislation. In spite of the sectional clamour against the legislation<br>
and the prediction of dire consequences to follow from it, the Government<br>
was returned to office at the general election last year. It may,<br>
therefore, be said that a majority of the electors have endorsed the<br>
Government's 1945 banking legislation and have approved the purpose<br>
for which it was enacted, namely, to give the Government full and<br>
effective control over monetary and banking policy in Australia. That<br>
object was made clear to Parliament and to the country.<br>
The Banking Act of 1945 was framed on the best constitutional<br>
advice and the Government felt confident that it would withstahd any<br>
legal challenge that might be directed against it. For example, it<br>
seemed quite clear that Parliament had made a law with respect to<br>
banking, and had thus acted within the scope of the powers conferred<br>
by section 51 ( xiii.) of the Constitution, when it enacted section 48 of<br>
the Banking Act. This section prohibited trading banks, other than<br>
State banks from carrying out banking business for a State or any<br>
authority of a State, including a local governing authority. The provision<br>
was regarded by the Government as an important part of the<br>
legislation. It embodied the principle that the banking business of all<br>
public bodies should be reserved to publicly-owned and controlled banks.<br>
Further, in most other countries it has long been accepted that all<br>
government banking business should be conducted through the central<br>
bank so as to give the central bank added strength to control the supply<br>
of credit and to enable it to take action in time to offset any disturbance<br>
to credit conditions resulting from government operations. In the<br>
aggregate the banking business of State governments and State<br>
authorities is large and so are some of their individual transactions. </p>
<p>They have an important bearing on current financial conditions. It was<br>
the Government's view that the powers of the central bank should be<br>
strengthened by making it as far as practicable the banker for public<br>
authorities. When challenged in the High Court, however, section 48<br>
was held to be invalid on the grounds that so long as private banks<br>
existed States and State authorities could not be denied the use of their<br>
facilities. The decision showed that full public control of banking as<br>
sought under the 1945 legislation could not be secured without pubiic<br>
ownership of banking.<br>
"" The decision forced the Government to re-examine all the circumstances,<br>
constitutional and otherwise, surrounding the legislation of<br>
1945. In particular, the Government has had to reconsider the constitutional<br>
basis of sections 18 to 22 of the Banking Act which required the<br>
private banks to make deposits in special accounts with the Commonwealth<br>
Bank and also the attitude of the private banks towards those<br>
sections. The special accounts are the crux of the control of credit given<br>
to the Commonwealth Bank by the Banking Act of 1945. The necessities<br>
of war-time finance greatly increased the base of liquid reserves<br>
on which trading banks normally build a superstructure of secondary<br>
credit. To prevent secondary inflation with rising prices it was necessary<br>
to imobilize some parts of the banks' deposits in special accounts<br>
with the Commonwealth Bank from which the banks were not allowed to<br>
withdraw any amounts, except with the consent of the Conimmonwealth<br>
Bank. If the amounts in these special accounts were freely available<br>
to the trading banks, they could, by increasing their advances, build up<br>
a secondary credit expansion of formidable dimensions. Added to the<br>
spending power already available to the public, this might easily<br>
produce a dangerous inflationary situation. It would be disastrous,<br>
from the point of view of the people of Australia and the prospects of<br>
economic stability, if sections 18 to 22 of the Banking Act were held to<br>
be invalid and the consequent loss of control over the banking system<br>
led to an inflation of credit, with all the loss and disorder which inflation<br>
entails. These sections necessarily severely limit the freedom of action<br>
of the trading banks. This was their intention. The Government was<br>
determined that the control of the Commonwealth Bank in this field<br>
should be absolute and beyond dispute.<br>
While the precise form of special accounts provided for in the<br>
Banking Act of 1945 was peculiar to Australia, the essential feature of<br>
the control of credit by this means are to be found in operation in<br>
Britain, Canada and a number of other countries. The same conditions<br>
which made a control of this kind essential in Australia have forced<br>
governments elsewhere to adopt similar measures. They are to-day an<br>
accepted part of central bank technique in many parts of the world.<br>
The private banks in Australia have always bitterly resented any<br>
attempt to place restrictions on their power to create or restrict credit.<br>
When the 1945 Banking Bill was before the House they fought these<br>
provisions with all the means, at their disposal. Towards the end of </p>
<p>1945, when the bill had become law, they were required to transfer their<br>
war-time special deposits to the special accoun's established under the<br>
new legislation and to make their first monthly lodgment to these<br>
accounts. The private banks, obviously acting in concert and on legal<br>
ndvice, made it clear a' that time that, while they were submitting to<br>
the legislation for the time being, they were reserving the right to<br>
rhalleng, it at a suitable opportunity. The following reservation was<br>
made by one of the Iank-. in a let'er to the Commonwealth Bank:-<br>
We are most anxiions. to co-operate with your Bank to ensure the continuance<br>
of our present harmonious relations, but you will appreciate that our duty to our<br>
shareholders compels us to have regard to our legal position; therefore, we feel<br>
it necessary to advise yon, with all due respect, that acquiescence or compliance<br>
on this Banik's part with any request or directions from you is not to be taken<br>
to import nny contract with your Bank in the terms of the Act.<br>
Statements to a similar effect were made in letters sent by six of<br>
the other banks. These reservations were brought to the notice of the<br>
Commonwealth Government at the time for legal consideration. This<br>
indication of the attitude of the private banks assumed greater significance<br>
when the special account system was challenged in the statement<br>
of claim made by Melbourne City Council in connexion with the section<br>
48 case-even though eventually the challenge to sections 18 to 22 of the<br>
Banking Act was not pressed. It assumed still greater significance<br>
when the High Court decision on section 48 made it clear that, although<br>
the Commonwealth Parliament had by the Constitution been given<br>
power to legislate on banking, nevertheless a law which was clearly a<br>
law with respect to banking could be held invalid on other constitutional<br>
considerations. The position which confronted the Government was<br>
that while doubts had arisen as to the constitutional validity of its banking<br>
legislation, there was evidence that the private banks were maintaining<br>
their hostility towards this legislation and were biding their time<br>
against a suitable opportunity to challenge it in the hope of throwing<br>
off the restraints they so strongly disliked.<br>
With economic difficulties increasing overseas the Government<br>
must be in a position to act with certainty and effectiveness to ensure<br>
fulfilment of its policy of full employment and the maintenance of economic<br>
and financial stability. During the war and since its conclusion<br>
the Australian economy has been kept more stable than the economy of<br>
any other country in the world. It must be remembered that an important<br>
part of the machinery for maintaining that stability has been the<br>
control over the banking system exercised under the 1945 banking<br>
legislation and that an essential part of that legislation is the special<br>
account procedure. The difficulties of the transition from war to peace<br>
are far from over. In fact, in some directions they are increasing.<br>
The rapid exhaustion of the United States loan to Britain has confronted<br>
the sterling area-and many other countries as well-with serious<br>
balance of payments problems and this is only one aspect of a general<br>
situation which is highly unstable. </p>
<p>"" To deal with the economic and financial problems both of the<br>
transition period and of the following years, the Government must have<br>
the necessary powers over banking and monetary policy. Fluctuations<br>
in business activity and employment are not solely due to monetary<br>
causes, but they are certainly greatly influenced by financial policy.<br>
The Government would not be justified in gambling on the outcome of<br>
possible threats to the 1945 legislation. The structure of banking based<br>
on the legislation of 1945 went part of the way towards the objectives<br>
which the Labour party has long advocated in regard to banking. At<br>
the same time it offered to the private banks the opportunity to cooperate<br>
within a national system of banking, subject to overall control<br>
by the Commonwealth Bank, as they had, in fact, done during the war<br>
period. That position was never accepted without reservation by the<br>
private banks and now that the legal foundations of the system have<br>
been challenged the Government has decided to proceed with its longstanding<br>
policy of full public ownership.<br>
The bill which is before the House gives effect to the Government's<br>
decision. Before the Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) left Australia, he<br>
gave close attention to the legal and constitutional aspects of the bill,<br>
and laid down the main lines on which the preparation of the measure<br>
has proceeded. I would emphasize that under this measure there will be no interruption<br>
or disturbance of the usual banking facilities available to the<br>
Australian community. The bill provides that the private banks shall<br>
maintain their services until they are taken over by the Commonwealth<br>
Bank. As the banks are taken over, either through the acquisition of<br>
their shares or of their assets, they will be kept in operation as going<br>
concerns. Customers will not notice any difference after the control<br>
of the bank with which they have been dealing has passed to the Commonwealth<br>
Bank. They will be able to continue their banking business<br>
without change or interruption.<br>
"" The bill imposes on the Commonwealth Bank an obligation to<br>
conduct its banking transactions in accordance with the practices and<br>
usages customary among bankers particularly in regard to the nondisclosure<br>
of information concerning the affairs of its customers. The<br>
confidential nature of the relationship between banker and customer is<br>
well established in law; and, subject to certain exceptions sanctioned<br>
or required by law, bankers are under an obligation of secrecy with<br>
respect to their customers' affairs. The bill specifically provides that<br>
this position will be preserved.<br>
"" Differences between the constitutions of the various private banks<br>
and the fact that some are incorporated in Australia and some overseas<br>
make it desirable to provide alternative ways in which the Commonwealth<br>
Bank may acquire their business. Accordingly the bill provides<br>
for two main processes of acquisition-<br>
Voluntary or compulsory acquisition of the Australian business and<br>
assets of the private banks, or<br>
Compulsory acquisition of shares. </p>
<p>"" The first could be applied to all banks, whether incorporated in<br>
Australia or overseas, and in the case of banks incorporated in. Australia,<br>
any part of their overseas assets may also be acquired compulsorily.<br>
Under the alternative procees, the shares of a private hank<br>
may be conmpulsorily acquired if the Treasurer is satisfied that the<br>
majority of its shares are registered in Australia. This process would<br>
be applied only to banks9 incorporated in Australia, and would be the<br>
initial step towards an eventual transfer of their business to the Commonwealth<br>
Bank. As a preliminary step to tb' acquisition of the<br>
business of a ) rivate bank, provision is m-ade for the Treasurer, by due<br>
notice, to invite the private bank to make an agreement with the Cornrnonweal'h<br>
Bank for the transfer of its business on a specified date,<br>
which must be not more than two months later than the date on which<br>
the notice is given. If an agreement for the transfer of the business of<br>
a private bank, which is willing to negotiate, is not completed by the<br>
specified date, the Treasurer may -extend the currency of the notice<br>
until agreement is reached. Agreement must, however, be reached-if<br>
there is to be agreement at all-before the notice expires. Once the notice<br>
expires, the assets of the bank concerned forthwith becomes vested in,<br>
and its liabilities are assumed by, the Commonwealth Bank. There is<br>
nothing in the bill to prevent the Commonwealth Bank from reaching<br>
an agreement with a private bank for the acquisition of its business<br>
before any notice is issued at all; but all agreements, whether made<br>
before or after notice is given, will be subject to the approval of the<br>
Treasurer. The bill also includes a provision whereby the Treasurer<br>
may, after the business of a private bank is acquired by the Commonwealth<br>
Bank, require that private bank to cease carrying on further<br>
banking business in Au-tralia.<br>
"" If a private bank enters into a voluntary agreement for the<br>
acquisition of its business by the Commonwealth Bank, it will be<br>
entitled to receive an exemption from taxation on the amount paid to it<br>
in pursuance of the agreement. It is further provided in the bill that<br>
shareholders of the bank will be exempt from taxation on any dividend<br>
or distribution which directly results from the payment received from<br>
the Commonwealth Bank under the agreement. These concessions will<br>
not apply in the case of a compulsory acquisition. The exemptions<br>
referred to will not relieve the private bank from liability for any tax<br>
payable by the bank in respect of profits derived in the normal course<br>
of its business but upon which the ordinary tax liability has not been<br>
met. The bank and its shareholders will still be liable to taxation in<br>
relation to profits earned after the year of income ended 30' h June, 1947,<br>
or any accounting period substituted therefore, and before the date of<br>
transfer, or in relation to any interest which may become payable under<br>
the agreement. If shares are acquired by voluntary purchase, the price paid by<br>
the Commonwealth Bank must not be less than the market value in<br>
Australia of those shares at 15th August, 1947. These prices have been </p>
<p>carefully ascertained and are specified. The provision iinade for the<br>
compulsory acquisition of shares will apply only to the share.-of private<br>
banks incorporated in Australia, which are the institutions referred to<br>
in Part I. of the First Schedule to the bill. Where the majority in<br>
number of the shares of any of these banks are situated in Australia,<br>
the bill provides that the Treasurer may, by notice published in the<br>
Gazette, declare that the shares in the bank concerned shall be vested<br>
in the Commonwealth Bank on a date specified by the Treasurer; and<br>
on that date the Commonwealth Bank will, by force of the legislation,<br>
become the holder (, othfe shares and a: m ember of the bank in question.<br>
"" It is provided that the directors of an Australian private bank,<br>
the shares of which have Leen compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth<br>
Bank, will cease to hold office on the date on which the compulsory<br>
acquisition becomes effective. The Governor of th
Bank will, with the approval of the Treasurer, thereupon appoint<br>
directors, including a chairman of directors. The directors appointed<br>
by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank will have full power to<br>
manage the bank in question, to dispose of its business in Australia<br>
to the Commonwealth Bank and to dispose also of the bank's business<br>
outside Australia: but any arrangement for disposal may only be concluded<br>
if approved by the Treasurer after he has received a reccommendation<br>
from the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank.<br>
For all property or shares of the banks, conmpulsorily acqtuiredl. fair<br>
and reasonable compensation will be payable. The compensation<br>
payable may be determined by agreement, approved by the Treasurcr<br>
or, failing agreement, the amount payable will be determined by th: e<br>
court of claims to be established under the proposed legislation. The<br>
bill sets out the procedure to be followed in reaching agreement or,<br>
alternatively, in referring claims to the court for determination. The<br>
bill provides for the establishment of a Federal Court of Claims consisting<br>
of a Chief Judge and such other judges as are appointed. The<br>
court may, if it thinks fit, appoint two assessors to assist it. The court<br>
will have jurisdiction to hear and determine claims for compensation<br>
arising under this bill. Regulations may be made under other acts<br>
also to confer jurisdiction on the court to determine claims arising out<br>
of the operation of those acts. The jurisdiction of the court in respect<br>
of compensation under this hill must be exercised by not. less than<br>
three judges. Jurisdiction may, however, be exercised by less than<br>
three judges by agreement between the parties concerned. A determination<br>
of the court will be final and conclusive and not subject to appeal<br>
to the High Court.<br>
"" The bill makes provision for the protection of officers of private<br>
banks in respect of continuance of employment, salaries and conditions<br>
of service. The bill provides that when the Commonwicalth Bank </p>
<p>proceeds by way of acquisition of the shares of a private bank, the<br>
salary and general conditions of service of officers of the private bank<br>
will not be disturbed, and will be secured to them. Similarly, when<br>
the Commonwealth Bank takes over the assets of a private bank,<br>
including the assets of a bank whose shares have previously been<br>
acquired, each officer of the private bank who was employed in the<br>
service of that bank in Australia will be entitled to be employed by<br>
the Commonwealth Bank at the salary and on the general conditions of<br>
service applicable to his existing employment. The Commonwealth<br>
Bank will be obliged to appoint each such officer, being a . British<br>
subject, to an appropriate position in the Commonwealth Bank Service.<br>
This will be done as soon as practicable after employment commences<br>
with"" the Commonwealth Bank. Special provision also is made to enable<br>
that service to absorb all officers stationed ou'side Australia whose duties<br>
are connected with the Australian business. It will be seen that during<br>
the period necessarily elapsing between the date of acquisition of a<br>
private bank, either by way of shares or assets of the private bank, and<br>
the date when an officer of that bank is appointed to an appropriate<br>
position in the Commonwealth Bank Service, he is fully safeguarded.<br>
He will continue to be employed with salary, pension benefits, and sick<br>
and long service leave at least as favorable as when in the employ of<br>
the private bank. When later appointed to the Commonwealth Bank<br>
Service, he will enjoy all the rights and privileges of an officer of that<br>
service, with protection in respect of existing salary, pension benefits,<br>
and sick and long service leave. Service in the private bank, continuous<br>
with service with the Commonwealth Bank, will count as service with<br>
the Commonwealth Bank for purposes of promotion, leave and pensions.<br>
To establish an officer's present entitlement to pension benefits and<br>
sick and long service leave, the bill provides for the appointment of a<br>
committee in respect of each private bank affected, consisting of a judge<br>
( or a person qualified to be a judge), an officer of the Commonwealth<br>
Bank, and a representative of the bank officers concerned, to ascertain<br>
the benefits which are, or woul'd have been granted in accordance with<br>
the practice of the private bank concerned, or of the superannuation<br>
fund of that bank. The findings of this committee will then become a<br>
legally enforceable right in respect of the future employment of these<br>
nfficers even though they may not have at present any such legal protection.<br>
The industrial awards now governing the employment of persons<br>
in private banks will continue in force until appointment to the Commonwealth<br>
Bank Service is made. Further, during this period, officers<br>
will continue to have the right to apply to the appropriate tribunal for<br>
variations of these awards. On appointment to the Commonwealth<br>
Bank they will have the same rights in respect of industrial matters as<br>
. lr, now enjoyed by officers of the Commonwealth Bank.<br>
The Commonwealth Bank is recognized as a good employer. On<br>
ihe whole the general conditions of employment in its service are at<br>
least as good as, if not better than, those generally provided by the </p>
<p>private banks. Its employees are given special legal protection as to<br>
promotion, dismissal and disciplinary action. Under Part XIII. of<br>
the Commonwealth Bank Act promotion and disciplinary appeal boards<br>
have been constituted. Those boards, which are under an independent<br>
chairman and include representatives of employees, are empowered to<br>
give final decisions on appeals relating, respectively, to the promotion<br>
and to the punishment, dismissal or reduction in status of officers.<br>
Such rights of appeal . are not at present enjoyed by employees of the<br>
private banks. The changed conditions of the expanded Commonwealth<br>
Bank will, of courst, render it necessary to examine the provisions of<br>
the Commonwealth Bank Act relating to the Commonwealth Bank<br>
Service, and any amendments considered desirable to -meet the position<br>
will be brought forward at an early date.<br>
"" With regard to former officers of the private banks who have<br>
retired on pensions from the private banks' services, their position, as<br>
well as that of dependants of deceased officers, is also fully safeguarded.<br>
The Commonwealth Bank will assume responsibility for the payment<br>
of pensions in accordance with existing rights, which will be converted<br>
into legally enforceable claims. As the Commonwealth Bank is required<br>
to assume liability for pensions, both in respect of retired officers and<br>
officers now serving, it is necessary that an appropriate amount of the<br>
superannuation funds established in association with the private banks<br>
to meet these obligations should be transferred to the Commonwealth<br>
Bank. The bill contains the necessary provisions to give effect to this<br>
requirement. "" There will be no necessity for a parliamentary appropriation to<br>
provide for compcnsation. In acquiring the business of the private<br>
banks the Commonwealth Bank will also assume the liabilities of these<br>
institutions. The amount of compensation payable will necessarily<br>
have regard to this factor and it will be well within the capacity of the<br>
Commonwealth Bank to meet the payment from its own resources. The<br>
Commonwealth Bank will make payment in cash or government bhond<br>
as desired. "" As I have said before, the Government believes that a publicly<br>
owned and controlled banking system, in which final responsibility for<br>
policy is in the hands of a government directly responsible to the<br>
electors, conforms much more closely to the luirements of a democratic<br>
community than the system advocated in 1945 by Mr. Menzieis,<br>
who, with his party, is pledged to restore control of banking and<br>
monetary policy to a body having no responsibility to the electors.<br>
In most advanced countries there has been during recent years a<br>
strong trend towards public ownership of key public utilities. This<br>
trend has not been confined to governments, representing particular<br>
political parties. Such projects have been brought forward both in<br>
Australia and elsewhere not only by Labour governments but also by </p>
<p>non-Labour ' go vernments who recognized that in the circumstances of<br>
the case the balance of advantages from the community standpoint lies<br>
in national rather than private ownership and control. But if any<br>
service fits the description of a key public utility it is banking. As I<br>
have said earlier, no element in the working of our economy has a<br>
greater influence for good or ev-il upon economic and social welfare<br>
than the management of money and credit.<br>
"" The Government is convinced that under public ownership the<br>
banking system will have immense opportunities for serving Australia.<br>
It will have the backing of the entire credit resources of the nation. It<br>
will be free from the cramping limitations of sectional private ownership<br>
which bid the private banks to serve this interest but not that<br>
interest, and to judge all business from the narrow standpoint of maximu-<br>
m profits for the smallest outlay. It will be able to take longer-term<br>
views of projects requiring finance and, since the whole Australian<br>
economy will be its field, it will have the widest scope for initiative<br>
and for the spread of its investments.<br>
"" Essentially tile task of the new organization will be to provide<br>
a financial mechanism appropriate to the needs of our rapidly growing<br>
economy. Australia is destined to see great developments in the coming<br>
years and this process, which is already under way, must be promoted<br>
by every every means possible. There will be a great increase in our<br>
population. Industries will expand in all fields and we must extend our<br>
markets abroad. The basic services of transport and communications,<br>
water supply, power, housing, health and education must be enlarged to<br>
meet the needs of a larger economy working at higher levels of technique<br>
and productivity. The stress everywhere will be upon new forms of<br>
enterpris e, new methodi of production, and new uses for the resourceis<br>
of this country. Finance must co-operate and take the initiative in<br>
this progress. As new types of industry are developed, new types of<br>
finance will be required and the banking system s-hould anticipate these<br>
needs and be in the field with the right kind of facilities to assist and<br>
encourage such development.<br>
Moreover, there can be no doubt that a bank should be more than<br>
a mere money lender. A banking system created to serve the welfare of<br>
the community can aid industry by the quality of its advice and the<br>
incidental services it renders as well as by the financial accommodation<br>
it provides. Hence the Government sets particular store on the developmnent<br>
of these ancillary services, It has in view the building up of a<br>
highly qualified staff that will enable the Commonwealth Bank to give<br>
skilled advice as part of its banking service. Secondary industries, for<br>
exa'mpkc, will be able to turn to the bank for the assistance of prodnction<br>
engineers and cost accountants to help them with their problems.<br>
Primary industries will have the aid of agricultural experts. I contemplate,<br>
too, that the Bank would establish, at least in the capital cities,<br>
departments of advice which would help individuals with their daily<br>
financial problems. Whiether any charge would have to be made by the </p>
<p>bank would naturally depend on the circumstances of each case but<br>
as far as possible these facilities would be provided freely as part of a<br>
Ftrengthened banking service.<br>
"" But if the financial system is to meet these requirements it tmust<br>
be comprehensive, strong and flexible. It must be alive to the requirements<br>
of the times and be capable of seeing ahead. It must have one<br>
goal for its policies and one standard for its work-the service of the<br>
nation in all its interests, great or small. The Government believes that<br>
only under a national system of banking can this ideal be approached.<br>
Only under such a system will finance be a real servant of industry and<br>
not its master.<br>
"" Fears are being spread by opponents of this measure that the<br>
people will lose an advantage by reason of having only one bank to<br>
deal with instead of a choice between several banks. This brings up the<br>
question of competition between the private banks-how far it exists<br>
and what it has been worth to the community and to customers of the<br>
banks. The Banking Commission went into this question of competition<br>
at great length. It found that the private banks did not compete in any<br>
serious way as regards interest rates and other charges but sought rather<br>
to attract customers by offering various other inducements. In general,<br>
they behaved in the manner of semi-monopolistic institutions which<br>
stood in fear of ruining their own market. There was certainly nothinglike<br>
the all-out rivalry to give the public the widest and cheapest services<br>
which we are asked to suppose exists between them. Amalgamations on<br>
the other hand have reduced the number of banks, so accentuating the<br>
monopolistic character of those that remain. There are to-day really no<br>
more than eight trading banks doing a nation-wide business where<br>
years ago there were twenty, -and we have no reason to suppose that this<br>
process would not go further if private banking continued. The average<br>
man, I suggest, will find it hard to believe that fewer banks mean greater<br>
competition. We recall how the former Commonwealth Bank Board, which<br>
considered itself to be conducting a bankers' bank, prevented the Commonwealth<br>
Bank from competing with the private institutions. We<br>
have the admissions of private bankers that competition between themselves<br>
is of a limited kind. We have seen the number of banks dwindling<br>
over the pears, each amalgamation removing one or more possible<br>
competitors from the ring. It is a fair conclusion, I think, that from<br>
the standpoint of benefit to the community, banking competition has<br>
meant little for some time past and would probably have meant less as<br>
time went on. On the other hand, I may point out that the Commonwealth<br>
Bank is charged under the legislation to be strictly impartial as<br>
between customers and to avoid all discrimination. A system of appeal<br>
will be provided so that a person who considers he has not had reasonable<br>
treatment from a local manager will be a'ble to refer his case to<br>
regional authority for reconsideration. Special arrangements will be </p>
<p>: made to ensure that this re-con. sileration is given without delay. In<br>
view of these considerations, therefore, it appears to me that the advantages<br>
of having a choice between several private banks as compared with<br>
. a single national bank are largely illusory.<br>
The proposal to take over the banks is being condemned in some<br>
quarters in recklessly extravagant terms; all kinds of hidden purposes<br>
are being wrongly ascribed to it from the same sources. The simple<br>
truth is this-the reasons and motives for this measure and the uses to<br>
which it can and will be applied are no more and no less than I have<br>
stated. The opponents of banking change seems always to have fought<br>
against new developments while belatedly approving such changes as<br>
have been made and which they had originally opposed. In 1937 they<br>
criticized the Banking Commission Report and defended the old<br>
syst-em. In 1945 they nailed their colours to the Banking Report and<br>
resisted implacably the legislation of that year. Now they seem disposed<br>
to make the 1945 legislation their rallying cry whilst preparing<br>
themselves once again to die in the last ditch against a new, logical<br>
and necessary developmen'. Their predictions of calamity will prove<br>
just as groundless as those they have expressed so many times before.<br>
There has been no political interference in banking under the 1945<br>
legislation and there will be none under the new system. In not one<br>
instance since that legislation was passed has the Government intervened<br>
in the administration of the Commonwealth Bank. Within the<br>
framework of the broad economic and financial policy laid down by<br>
the Government the bank has carried on its work successfully and harmnoniously.<br>
On broad policy issues it has in turn advised the Government<br>
and been advised by the Government. Conflict has not arisen at<br>
any stage. It is timely to record that under section 9 of the Commonwealth<br>
Bank Act 1945 the Government cannot interfere in the internal<br>
transactions of the bank. Its power is limited to the laying down where<br>
necessary of the broad lines of monetary and banking policy. Business<br>
people and private citizens will have all the safeguards as to the conduct<br>
of their banking business which can be given by law and by the<br>
long and honorable administrative tradition of the Commonwealth<br>
Bank. On acquisition of a bank, shareholders are assured of just compensation,<br>
bank employees are protected, depositors are guaranteed and<br>
business will be carried on without interruption.<br>
Full public ownership of the banks will ensure control of banking<br>
in the public interest. It will enable effective steps to be taken against<br>
the dangers of secondary inflation. It will assist us to stave off depres-<br>
. sion and to avoid a repetition of the miseries of 1930. Beyond this, it<br>
will o0 : nu a lung-locked doorway to the development of a monetary and<br>
banking system truly adequate to our national requirements and wholly<br>
devoted to the service of Australia [ The bill was passed. </p>

"" I understand that members of the Opposition last week pressed<br>
for an inquiry into Communist activities in Australia. It is true that<br>

but also other persons whose activities might be detrimental<br>
to the interests of this country. Nothing has been disclosed to date<br>

In Parliament.-On 21st October, 1947, the Minister for Repatriation<br>
( Mr. Barnard) introduced the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation<br>
Bill. Mr. Barnard said-<br>
The bill is to bring provisions for control of patriotic funds under<br>
the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. The existing . provisions are<br>
National . Security ( Patriotic Funds) Regulations under the Defence-<br>
( Transitional Provisions) Act. The main activities of the funds are<br>
diminishing, and many have already been wound up, but others are<br>
continuing their ordinary operations, and will eventually go through<br>
the winding-up stage. Altogether, it is probable that, in some -form or<br>
another, activities will continue for some time yet. It is therefore<br>
desirable that the provisions be removed from the Defence ( Transitional<br>
Provisions) Act. They are administered by the Minister for<br>
Repatriation and the Repatriation Commission, and the logical place<br>
for them is in the repatriation legislation. The bill inserts a section<br>
in the Repatriation Act to enable the Governor-General to make the<br>
necessary regulations under that act. National Security ( Patriotic<br>
Funds) Regulations will be repealed, and the new regulations in the<br>
Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Regulations will . be generally on the<br>
same lines as those under which control has * been exercised up till now.""<br>

been necessary to meet changed circumstances resulting from greatly<br>
increased demand for materials. The new procedure provided for the<br>
determination of priority for building war service homes on the basis<br>
of need. Applicants who had been requested by the War Service<br>
Homes Commission to pay preliminary fees or arrange for the preparation<br>
of plans and specifications by a private architect under the<br>
previous priority system would be finalized under that system, but the<br>
priority of all other applications would be decided in accordance with'<br>
the new policy of determining priority on a needs basis.<br>

preparatory committee has had two sessions-at London towards the<br>
end of 1946 and more recently at Geneva. A special drafting cominittee<br>

TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT-PREPARATORY COMMITTEE,<br>
MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br>
In Parliament.-On 29th October, 1947, the Minister for Post-war<br>
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) said-<br>
"" 1 make a brief statement in relation to tariff negotiations at<br>
Geneva in which an Australian delegation has been engaged for some<br>
time. Since April, 1947, the delegation has been conducting negotiations<br>
with the re. presentatives of seventeen other countries for the<br>
readjustment of tariffs and preferences on a mutually advantageous<br>
basis. These negotiations have reached finality and the results are<br>
being incorporated in a draft general agreement on tariff and trade </p>
<p>which is to be laid before the governments concerned for their consideration.<br>
The large number of countries concerned involves certain practical<br>
difficulties which have to be overcome. In the first place, it is<br>
virtually impossible to keep proposed tariff changes completely confidential<br>
for an indefinite period. Publication of the results in one<br>
country before release in another could be very embarrassing.<br>
Moreover, if the published rates differed from those at present<br>
in force complications would arise because of the desire of<br>
traders to wait for lower rates of duty. Further, the several<br>
countries concerned have a variety of procedures for putting trade agreements<br>
into force. To overcome those difficulties, a method has been<br>
devised to provide for the simultaneous publication of the draft general<br>
agreement on tariffs -and trade, and for the provisional application<br>
of that agreement by the governments concerned. The countries concerned<br>
may, instead of adopting the agreement outright, agree to apply.<br>
provisionally, its provisions, including the tariff schedules. Their legislatures<br>
will then -be able to examine the agreement and decide whether<br>
or not it should be adopted.<br>
Provided the requisite number of governments concur and notify<br>
the Secretary-General of the United Nations by 15th November, 1947,<br>
that they are prepared to adopt, provisionally, the draft agreement, the<br>
text will -be published on 18th November, 1947.<br>
The Australian Government believes that the proposed agreement<br>
will prove advantageous to Australia. Accordingly, it has decided to<br>
accept and . apply, provisionally, the draft general agreement on tariffs<br>
and trade. The following procedure will be followed: On 30th October,<br>
1947, the final act of the Geneva conference will be signed for the purpose<br>
of authenticating the text of the draft general agreement. On or<br>
before 15th November, 1947, the Government will inform the Secretary-<br>
General of the United Nations that it is prepared to accept and apply,<br>
provisionally, the general agreement on tariffs and trade. On 18th<br>
November, 1947, if the requisite number of governments have decided<br>
to accept the general agreement on tariffs and trade provisionally, the<br>
agreement will be published simultaneously in the countries concerned.<br>
On that date, the Australia -Government will lay the agreement on the<br>
table of the House, and introduce the necessary tariff motion. The new<br>
rates will become operative provisionally from that date.<br>
Later, after conclusion of the Havana conference and within six<br>
months of the tabling of the draft agreement, the Government will<br>
decide whether Parliament is to be asked to confirm the agreement and.<br>
if it so decides, will seek Parliament's approval for this course.<br>
A statement on all phases of the Geneva conference will be made to<br>
the House later in this session. For reasons I have outlined, it is not<br>
possible, before the date agreed on for publication, to give any details<br>
of the concessions made. However, I can assure the House that the<br>
Government is convinced that the draft agreement will create new<br>
export opportunities of great value to Australia. Throughout the </p>
<p>negotiations the Government has maintained the closest collaboration<br>
with other members of the British Conunonwealth. The agreement<br>
takes full account of the legitimate interests of both . primary and<br>
secondary industries in this country; and, in relation to imperial preferences,<br>
the agreement conforms to the policy enunciated ' by the Government<br>
from time to time in this House.<br>
Beyond these assurances, it would be improper for me to go at this<br>
stage. Further, speculation is likely to be misleading and embarrassing<br>
to all governments concerned. The Government, therefore, invites the<br>
co-operation of the House and of the press until publication becomes<br>
possible.' FOURTH SECURITY LOAN.<br>
PRIME ~ VINISTER'S OPENING BROADCAST.<br>
On 28th October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) broadcast<br>
over the national network. Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Good evening ladies and gentlemen,<br>
The Fourth Security Loan of œ 80,000,000 will be opened on 29th<br>
October, 1947. The people of Australia are asked to subscribe<br>
œ 48,000,000 for the programme of Commonwealth and State works<br>
approved by the seven governments and for the rehabilitation of<br>
former mem. bers of the fighting forces.<br>
In addition, holders of securities in loans floated in the early years<br>
of the war to a total of œ 32,000,000 are asked to convert their holdings<br>
into new bonds in the Fourth Security Loan. Therefore, the loan which<br>
will be opened to-morrow is for a total of œ 80,000,000 and, in the name<br>
of the Commonwealth and State Governments of Australia, I ask that<br>
it be over-subscribed.<br>
The two financial operations involved in this loan-namely, the<br>
subscription of new money and the conversion of old bonds-are a<br>
vital part of the over-all economic policy being followed by the Australian<br>
Government.<br>
"" That policy has been followed with the dual purpose of maintaining<br>
the economic balance in this country and of ensuring that Australia,<br>
as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, can fully<br>
play her part for the welfare of all member nations and of Britain in<br>
particular. The Australian Government's economic policy during the war<br>
years and in post-war years that have followed have been amazingly<br>
successful. To-day, the Australian œ 1 purchases more for the Australian<br>
citizen in Australia than the American dollar does for Americans<br>
or the œ 1 sterling does for the people in the United Kingdom.<br>
Further, Australia is one of four nations in the world whose price rise<br>
has ' been the lowest. </p>
<p>Those two facts demonstrate very clearly that the Commonwealth<br>
Government's economic policy has resulted in the maximum welfare for<br>
Australian men and women as individuals and for Australia as a<br>
nation. You, the people of Australia, are asked to ensure the smooth<br>
continuance of that policy by an over-subscription for the Fourth<br>
Security Loan.-By so doing, you will make a contribution not only to<br>
your own security but will maintain Australia's economic strength so<br>
that she can continue to be a strong right arm for Britain in her<br>
struggle. As you know, the Australian Government has laid down a . policy<br>
of the . fullest possible assistance to the United Kingdom on the following<br>
lines:-Export of the greatest volume of foodstuffs.<br>
A gift of œ 23,000,000.<br>
Export of current Australian gold production so that Britain<br>
can use it to buy dollars.<br>
Severe restrictions on Australian use of dollars.<br>
The success of the Fourth Security Loan is essential so that the<br>
policy I have outlined to you may , be maintained. I ask you to oversubscribe<br>
the amount asked for in new money-œ 48; 000,000-and to<br>
convert fully the œ 32,000,000 of securities from earlier loans. The<br>
loan will open to-morrow and I am fully confident that you will play<br>
your part as Australians.""<br>

of Post-war Reconstruction was co-opted. In 1945, Commonwealth and<br>
State Governments -agreed to the formation of a National Mapping<br>
Council to ensure the co-ordination of mapping activities.<br>
Cabinet decided to-day to re-constitute the committee to provide<br>
for the Commonwealth Surveyor-General, who is also Director of the<br>
National Mapping Council, as chairman, and a representative of each<br>
of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the three service<br>
departments, the departments of Civil Aviation, Post-war Reconstruction<br>
and Supply and Shipping. The committee's function will be to<br>

GERMANY-RESUMPTION.<br>

announced that the control authorities of the combined British-United<br>
States zone in Germany were now permitting the entrance of limited<br>
numbers of Australian businessmen to buy Oerman goods. Buyers<br>
would be admitted into the zone for periods not normally exceeding<br>
fourteen days. Because of the small quota allotted to Australia, sponsorship<br>
would be accorded only to those businessmen who desired to<br>
purchase goods considered essential in the national interest. Selection<br>
for sponsorship would take into account the range and quantity of goods<br>
available for export from Germany and the limitations on imports imposed<br>
by the Australian import licensing system.<br>

of chassis would he considered by an inter-departmental committee on<br>
which the trade would be represented. In the light of the subsequent<br>
deterioration in the dollar situation, the Government had reconsidered<br>
the matter to effect further economies. It had been decided that the<br>
maximum amount be allotted for the importation of motor vehicle<br>
chassis from the United States and Canada during 1948 was<br>
œ A. 8,000,000. It has been decided to abandon the former system of<br>
allocating quotas on a quantitative -basis and to fix a total c. i. f. and e.<br>
ceiling value for each make and model of chassis. It would be necessary<br>
to impose the condition that the value of the chassis to'be imported<br>
during the first half of 1948 be not more than half the approved quota<br>
value. ( For earlier -references, please see No. 125, page 29; No. 128, page 33.)<br>
WAR H ISTORY.<br>
WAR INDUSTRIES.<br>
On 4th November, 1947, the Minister for the Interior ( Mr.<br>
Johnson) announced that Dr. D. P. Mellor, of Sydney University, had<br>
been chosen to write the volume of the Australian official war history<br>
dealing with war industries and the application of scientific research<br>
to war-time needs. Re succeeded Dr. A. S. Fitzpatrick who was unable<br>
to continue the work.<br>

<p>JAPAN.<br>
WAR CRIMINALS-SIR WILLIAM WEBB'S RETURN.<br>
On 4th November, 1947, the Prime Minister. ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" At my request, the Australian Government's representative on the<br>
International Military Tribunal at Tokio ( Sir William Webb) has<br>
arranged to return to Australia alriost imnmediately. This ivill enable<br>
him to take his seat on the High Court Bench for the forthcoming<br>
Sydney sittings. Sir William will return to Tokio, if necessary, ( luring<br>
the summer vacation to complete his work as president of the tribunal.<br>
"" A seventh justiceship was restored to the High Court in April,<br>
1946. When Sir Willi-am was appointed in May, 1946, it was anticipated<br>
that his work at Tokio would last only a few months longer. The<br>
trials have been unexpectedly long and Sir William ha~ s so far been<br>
unable to assume his judicial duties here.""<br>

TRANSITION.<br>
CONTROLS-FURTHER BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
it. Parliament On 5th November, 1947, the Minister fox Post-war<br>
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) introduced the Defence ( Transitional<br>
Provisions) Bill. Mr. Dedman said-<br>
The purpose of this ' bill is to continue the operation for a further<br>
period of twelve months of certain National Security Regulations, the<br>
operation of which has already been prolonged by the Defence ( Transitional<br>
Provisions) Act 1946 until the end of December, 1947. When<br>
the Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) introduced the bill for that act he<br>
dealt fully with the constitutional -basis for the bill. At that time, I<br>
think that we all believed that by December, 1947, we should be able<br>
to dispense with many of the regulations then in operation. However,<br>
events have proved otherwise. Tihe principal reason is, that western<br>
Europe has not succeeded in regaining a state of economic health. In<br>
November, 1946, it appeared that the economic recovery of Europe<br>
would not be unduly delayed, but since then Europe has experienced an<br>
exceptionally severe winter, followed by a drought. During 1946, the<br>
fact that the balance had been upset between the productive power and<br>
resources of the western hemisphere, on the one hand, and those of the<br>
rest of the world on the other, was obscured by the vast quantities of<br>
goods poured into Europe by Unrra and other organizations. The disastrous<br>
effects of winter and drought were followed by the dollar crisis.<br>
Those events have had repercussions extending far beyond Europe;<br>
indeed they threaten the foundations of world economy. In his speech in<br>
1946, Dr. Evatt emphasized the need for the retention of measures designed<br>
to check inflation and maintain stability. The Oovernment at<br>
that time indicated its view that the operation of regulations covering<br>
price control, rent control, capital issues, and land sales, would need to<br>
be continued beyond December, 1947. The -bill makes provision for the<br>
continuation of those regulations for a further twelve months. </p>
<p>No one would argue that price control has not been highly successful<br>
in helping to keep the economy of Australia steady. A comparison<br>
of the figures of the cost of living in Australia to-day with those for<br>
the period following World War and those of countries which have<br>
abandoned price control, prove the wisdom of the Government's action<br>
in continuing the operation of war-time price control regulations in the<br>
post-war period. To-day, Australia is one of the countries which shows<br>
the lowest increase of prices, and a comparison of living costs with<br>
those of other nations where prices control has lapsed, or has never<br>
been enforced, proves how well we have controlled the post-war boom.<br>
The United Nations' monthly ' bulletin of statistics for September, 1947,<br>
shows that Australia is only one in a list of 35 countries in which the<br>
rise of wholesale prices since 1937 has been less than 50 per cent. The<br>
same authority gives the following percentage increases of retail prices<br>
from 1939, to June, 1947:-Australia 28; South Africa 39; Canada<br>
32; United Kingdom 29; United . States of America 57; Argentine<br>
Sweden 52; Switzerland 56; Spain 109; Ireland 70; Turkey 245;<br>
Poland 15,010; and China 2,087,900. The indications are that during<br>
1948, the Australian price level will be subjected to pressure, as it was<br>
in 1947. By V. P. Day, export prices had increased by 78 per cent.<br>
over pre-war prices, and by 183 per cent. by June, 1947. Import<br>
prices rose by 99 and 147 per cent., respectively. There is no sign of<br>
the increase of overseas prices steadying as yet, and there is no doubt<br>
that a serious post-war boom is taking place in the international field.<br>
Under these conditions it would not be wise to remove the existing<br>
control over prices.<br>
An attempt to control prices generally without controlling the land<br>
values would because of the present state of demand, permit serious distortions<br>
of the whole cost-price structure. Excessive land values would<br>
greatly inflate the cost of home-building and would make the administration<br>
of rent control extremely difficult, if not impossible. The effect<br>
on rural industries must also be particularly serious. When producers<br>
are receiving high returns for their products, speculation becomes rampant<br>
and land changes hands at boom prices financed by mortgage loans.<br>
Then, when export prices decline, many producers find themselves ' burdened<br>
with debt and high costs. A long and painful re-adjustment becomes<br>
inescapable; and the result is a general state of depression<br>
throughout the rural industries. To prevent a repetition of such experiences,<br>
and to prevent execessive land values from unduly inflating costs<br>
generally, it is proposed to continue the control of land values for a<br>
further twelve months under this bill.<br>
"" Speculative investments are not confined to land. At present there<br>
is a large supply of capital awaiting investment, but it is impossible<br>
for all of it to be employed without making inordinate demands on the<br>
available resources of material and man-power. It is clearly desirable<br>
that resources should be concentrated on essential production and not be<br>
diverted to speculative or unnecessary enterprises. It is, therefore, proposed<br>
to continue the Capital Issues Regulations.<br>
7081.-3 </p>
<p>Rent control is a special aspect of economic controls, and its continuance<br>
is rendered necessary by the present shortage of accommodation<br>
of all kinds. It ensures a measure of stability where stability is<br>
most needed. Its removal, and the removal of control over evictions<br>
under present conditions, would result in inflation of rents, wholesale<br>
evictions, exploitation and much misery.<br>
"" I mention briefly some marketing regulations which it is proposed<br>
should be continued. The regulations under this group include those<br>
relating to the control of barley, apples and pears, hides and leather,<br>
potatoes, rabbit skins, as well as the acquisition of wheat and the<br>
stabilization of the wheat industry. The reasons for continuing these<br>
regulations are simply that the conditions which necessitated their<br>
introduction are still with us, and the Commonwealth must keep the<br>
faith with the primary producers. The detailed considerations differ<br>
somewhat, depending on the commodity. In respect of the Australian<br>
Barley Board, it was expected that legislation would be enacted by the<br>
South Australian and Victorian Governments to carry on after the<br>
end of 1947 the authority originally established by the Commonwealth,<br>
but the sudden dissolution of the Victorian Parliament has delayed the<br>
necessary legislation in that State, and the Commonwealth is accordingly<br>
obliged to continue the regulations so that there will be no disorder<br>
in the handling of the forthcoming crop. Refrigerated shipping<br>
space for the apple and pear crops of Tasmania and Western Australia<br>
is still inadequate, and hence the continuance of assistance is necessary<br>
to protect the growers in those States. As regards potatoes, the Commonwealth<br>
has let contracts to growers for the 1947-48 crop, and the<br>
regulations are intended to control marketing until the crop<br>
is sold. It is hoped that by the end of 1948 the organizations of the<br>
States will be ready to take over potato marketing. Wheat regulations<br>
are intended to cover the marketing of the 1947-48 crop. It has not<br>
been practicable to reach agreement on a permanent marketing scheme<br>
for the industry, but a further conference with the States will be held<br>
shortly. Meanwhile the Commonwealth is continuing the Australian<br>
Wheat Board in accordance with the desires of the growers and all<br>
State Governments. In fact, no other organization could satisfactorily<br>
market the crop. Controls over hides, leather and rabbit skins are<br>
necessary mainly for price stabilization purposes, as the world prices<br>
of these commodities greatly exceed the domestic prices. A limited<br>
section of the food control regulations is preserved so that the distribution<br>
of certain fats and oils can be equitably arranged, and also that<br>
essential service supplies may be obtained.<br>
There is a group of regulations which affect servicemen still serving<br>
in the occupation forces in Japan. It is obviously necessary to<br>
keep in force the Military Forces, Naval Forces and Women's Service<br>
Regulations. There are still a few internees and prisoners of war in<br>
Australia, and although very few are affected by them the provisions<br>
by which their detention is regulated must remain in force. </p>
<p>37<br>
"" Parliament has considered several bills dealing with industrial<br>
conditions-notably the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration<br>
Act, the Stevedoring Act and the Coal Act. These enactments go back<br>
some distance in bringing back to a peace-time footing the framework<br>
within which industrial conditions are settled. There are still, however,<br>
fields to which attention has not been given, particularly the maritime<br>
industry and the craft unionists employed in the coal industry. Pending<br>
some further clarification in these fields, the existing regulations<br>
must be preserved for a time.<br>
Superphosphate regulations have been discontinued and the operation<br>
of the Agricultural Aids Regulations restricted to a single item of<br>
nicotine sulphate. The prospect of a record harvest has aggravated the<br>
demand for both cornsacks and galvanized iron, and control over these<br>
commodities must be continued for some time longer. While Britain's<br>
position is so critical it is unthinkable for Australia to remove all<br>
restrictions on commodities which are needed so badly there, and<br>
accordingly ration schemes are being continued, particularly in relation<br>
to meat and butter.<br>
"" About one do. en sets of regulations will be continued. They are<br>
those under which war materials are being disposed of, war damage<br>
claims settled, compensation with regard to requisitioned cargoes<br>
assessed, property of enemy nationals administered, and the hundred<br>
and one other things necessary to unwind the war effort. A good many<br>
of the provisions of this sort cannot be dispensed with until the Treaty<br>
of Peace is signed with Japan.<br>
In 1946, a few amendments were made in permanent legislation.<br>
This bill gives permanent expression in appropriate acts to some provisions<br>
hitherto contained in National Security Regulations. The Acts<br>
Interpretation Act is amended in two respects. One provision is made<br>
to cover the case where the functions of one department are transferred<br>
to another department. Reference to the former department or its<br>
Minister will be read in an agreement as referring to the latter department<br>
or its Minister. Secondly, there is a provision relating to delegation<br>
of powers or functions. This provision permits the exercise of<br>
powers or functions by a delegate in circumstances in which the exercise<br>
of the power or function is dependent on the opinion, belief or state<br>
of mind of the person exercising the power. An amendment made in<br>
1946 to the Land Tax Assessment Act is continued for a further year.<br>
This amendment continued for land tax purposes pegging of land values<br>
which, up to that time had been pegged at 1939 values by regulation<br>
under the National Security Act. The assessment of land tax on land<br>
owned as at 30th June, 1948, will be based on the 1939 value.<br>
"" Action is being taken to amend the Defence Act by exempting from<br>
jury service members of the Citizen Forces engaged on war service.<br>
Probably the most important of these changes in permanent legislation<br>
is the clause which repeals the National Registration Act. The Government<br>
regards the National Registration Act as a type of legislation </p>
<p>which is undesirable during peace-time. It is the policy of the Government<br>
to embody in permanent legislation at the earliest possible date<br>
provisions now contained in National Security Regulations and which<br>
it is desirable shall have permanent effect as part of the law of the<br>
Commonwealth. This bill is one of a group of about half a dozen bills<br>
which deal with matters previously covered ' by National Security Regu-'<br>
lations. Already the Dairy Produce Export Control'bill has been introduced<br>
and one of the effects of its pas-sage would be that the Dairy<br>
Produce Acquisition Regulations will be permitted to lapse at the end<br>
of the year. The Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill contains a provision<br>
permitting regulations to be made about patriotic funds, and<br>
accordingly the Patriotic Funds Regulations will not be ' Continued next<br>
year. Other legislation involving amendments to other acts is in train,<br>
and will be introduced as early as possible. When thes3e bills are intro<br>
duced, opportunity will be taken to place in permanent form some of<br>
the provisions now carried on temporarily."" [ Teblwapsed<br>

<p>INDUSTRIAL.<br>
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS-CONFERENCE, DECISIONS.<br>
On 3rd August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
While I survey with satisfaction the great increase in the industrial<br>
capacity of Australia, the existence of full employment in the community,<br>
the progress made in providing a degree of economic security<br>
for our people, I am gravely concerned with the shortages of houses<br>
and of goods needed by the people and the delays in carrying out works<br>
vital to the maintenance and development of this country.<br>
Manpower shortages will not permit the accumulated needs of the<br>
war years to be overtaken and current requirements to be met at once<br>
or in the immediate future. I am convinced, however, that Australians<br>
united in effort-as they were in war-can attack and overcome more<br>
speedily a situation that is detrimental to the economy of the nation<br>
and the best interests of its people.<br>
To-day, Australia has the greatest opportunity in its history.<br>
There is a world shortage of basic commodities which Australia excels<br>
in producing. High prices are obtainable for our exports. New<br>
markets are opening for both our primary and secondary products.<br>
Internally, industry has vast plans for expansion, and there is opportunity<br>
for intense activity in the building of houses, hospitals, schools,<br>
factories and development of roads, airports, railways, water conservation<br>
and electrical schemes. If we do not take full advantage of this<br>
opportunity it will be mainly because individual Australians have<br>
failed-failed to realize that Australia's good is their good and that<br>
of their children.<br>
"" I appeal then to every individual Australian to give of his best<br>
in whatever occupation he may follow. To do less is a denial of the<br>
needs of his fellow Australians. Let each Australian then develop a<br>
new spirit-a new vision of the personal importance of his efforts to<br>
this country and his fellows. I appeal to the leaders of the trades union<br>
movement to exercise firm discipline over the units they lead, to prevent<br>
unauthorized strikes, to eliminate inter-union disputes, to avoid disputes<br>
over small matters, and to concentrate their efforts and thoughts on<br>
the production this country so sorely needs. I call on each unionist to<br>
give unswerving loyalty to such leaders. I call on the employers of<br>
this country for more production, for the utmost efficiency in their<br>
methods, for a greater personal interest in the industrial problems of<br>
the human beings who are their employees, for the provision of better<br>
working conditions for those employees, for a broad tolerance towards<br>
workers suffering from the strain of war and experiencing a natural<br>
reaction to war-time conditions. Above all, I ask them to be ready<br>
and generous in sharing with their employees the benefits of the<br>
increased production that I feel confident will take place.<br>
"" I ask that all parties in industry will avoid those things that<br>
have been sapping the industrial strength of this country and preventing<br>
the achievement of higher living standards for our people. I invite </p>
<p>willing acceptance of the principle of conciliation and arbitration and<br>
trust that all. will co-operate in giving a fair trial to the new scheme<br>
of arbitration and conciliation which will soon be in operation.<br>
This country cannot but be affected by the economic changes<br>
taking place beyond its -boundaries. It is vital that our own econom3<br>
be stabilized to meet possible repercussions from abroad. Steady work<br>
by each and every Australian will be the most powerful factor in<br>
aIchieving this. Given this, we protect ourselves, we give the best aid<br>
to Britain in its sore plight, we make a contribution to the solidity and<br>
welfare of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and we do something<br>
for the stricken people of countries devastated by war-peoples afflicted<br>
with a spiritual and physical misery never known in this country and<br>
the depths of which are so abysmal as to be almost beyond<br>
. omprehension. "" I am pleased with the results of the conference over which I<br>
presided in Canberra, and I feel that the people of Australia have much<br>
to hope for from the operation of the machinery for closer consultation<br>
between employers. employee, and the Government that has been<br>
established."" On 3rd August, 1947. Mr. Chifley, the PresideL-r of th:.<br>
Australasian Council of Trades Unions ( Mr. P. J. Clarey, M. L. C.)<br>
and the President of the A\ ssociated Chambers of Manufactures. ( Mr.<br>
Robinson) said-<br>
"" The three constituent bodies associated witlh industry, the Government,<br>
the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia and the<br>
A\ ustralasian Council of Trade Unions having met in conference have<br>
reached the following conclusions:-<br>
1. Increased production is essential for the continuance of satisfactory<br>
Australian living standards; their improvement; the meeting<br>
of many shortages in both capital and consumable goods, and for the<br>
relieving of the inconveniences and hardships at present being<br>
experienced by Australian citizens. These shortages relate to the things<br>
which intimately concern the life of Australian men and women, such<br>
as housing, clothing and many other commodities. The parties, therefore,<br>
agree that every effort should be made to stimulate and promote.<br>
production to the highest possible point, consistent with existing manpower<br>
and productive resources. This is a matter in which all must<br>
co-operate. It is the function of not one section of society, but of all.<br>
The parties believe there are ways in which this increased production<br>
can be achieved, notwithstanding the belief that all sections of"" the<br>
community are now honourably playing their part. It is suggested that<br>
the three constituent parties endeavour to stimulate production by<br>
means of more efficient management, where possible, the introduction<br>
of up-to-date plant and machinery, the elimination of waste, by using<br>
every effort to reduce labour turn-over by cutting out unnecessary<br>
absenteeism, and to prevent the abuse of sick leave provisions. This<br>
appeal is made not only in the interests of the people of AuAtral) a. </p>
<p>but also that the people of Australia can play their part in making<br>
more commodities available to the people of Britain, and enabling<br>
commodities to be secured from other countries in the world for our<br>
convenience and welfare.<br>
Consideration of the production needs of Australia have indic:<br>
ated tlat two major bottlenecks exist toward the overcoming of<br>
which the influence of the three parties should be exerted to the fullest.<br>
The major bottleneck, that of coal, is one which the parties feel can<br>
be best solved by the recently appointed Joint Coal Board, which is now<br>
concentrating its efforts on a solution of this great economic problem.<br>
We make an earnest appeal to the coal miners and those closely engaged<br>
in the production of coal, and its distribution, to assist to their utmost.<br>
The other major bottleneck is that of man-power. The economic<br>
expansion of Australia during the last seven years has made a great<br>
demand for additional men and women for industry. The parties<br>
suggest that many persons who gave fully and freely of their services<br>
during the war period to help the nation in its period of stress should,<br>
as far as possible, make themselves available to industry to overcome<br>
the grave shortages resulting from an almost complete war-time cessation<br>
of production of consumable goods which must now be made available,<br>
in addition to normal peace-time requirements of the nation.<br>
3. It was evident to the conference that. from a general review<br>
of the economic and employment position, free or private enterprise<br>
in the past and at present is the major avenue for providing work.<br>
It is, therefore, the avenue providing the greatest measure of employment.<br>
Complete understanding between the controllers of enterprise<br>
: end representatives of the workers is, therefore, essential if industrial<br>
relations are to be established on a satisfactory basis.<br>
4. The matter of prevention and settlement of industrial disputes<br>
ictween employer and employee is fundamental to the efficient and<br>
smooth running of industry. All parties to the conference agree that<br>
the conciliation and arbitration machinery provided by the Commonwvealth<br>
and the States provides a means whereby differences between<br>
t: mployer and employee should be readily determined. In the settlement<br>
of industrial disputes, conciliation should be exercised to the<br>
fullest before final resort is made to arbitration. It is desirable in the<br>
interests of the community that industrial disputes should be reduced<br>
to the barest possible minimum. The trades union representatives have<br>
expressed their disagreement with unauthorized strikes arising without<br>
consultation, either with the trades union concerned, the Trades and<br>
Labour Council of the States, or the Australasian Council of Trade<br>
Unions ini the Federal sphere.<br>
5. The right of the worker to share in the proceeds of industry is<br>
ine which has received the full consideration of conference. It is<br>
agreed by all parties that increased standards of living are only possible<br>
from constantly increasing production of goods and services required.<br>
The right of the vorker to recefive his proportionate share of increased </p>
<p>production is recognized, but the manner in which this should be granted<br>
to workers in industry is subject to difference of opinion. The<br>
employers have suggested that a satisfactory solution would be for the<br>
introduction or extension of incentive payments, which would.. give.. a<br>
daily or weekly benefit to the worker from the results of his immediate<br>
higher production. The trades union attitude is one of distaste for<br>
incentive payment, based on past experience. The Australasian Council<br>
of Trade Unions intimated to the conference -that it is prepared to make<br>
a full and complete investigation into modern incentive payment systems<br>
to determine whether such systems would be of advantage to the worker<br>
and the community. The employers intimated to the trades union<br>
representatives that they were prepared to place before thern information<br>
requested and give assistance so that this investigarion could be<br>
thoroughly undertaken.<br>
The holding of this conference to achieve better understanding<br>
between the partners of industry has indicated that view points on<br>
matters of policy and principle have varied greatly. The conference,<br>
however, has enabled both parties in a free and frank manner to state<br>
their views and the reasons for them. Conference is, therefore, of the<br>
opinion that frequent consultations of this character are essential for<br>
securing better industrial relations and undisturbed continuity of production.<br>
It is agreed that similar conferences should be held at six<br>
monthly periods so that econome trends, industrial and other problems<br>
might be fully considered.<br>
The parties agree to advise each other as to matters which<br>
they feel should be considered by conference so that they may be able<br>
to investigate such matters with a view to decisions being arrived at<br>
when conference meets<br>

UNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.<br>
On 1st September, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)<br>
said that unemployment in Australia was at record low levels and<br>
continued to fall month by month. At 31st July, 1947, the number<br>
of unemployed persons receiving financial benefits totalled 5,364 males<br>
and 192 females, nearly 700 below the total for June, 1947. At 31st<br>
July, 1947, the Commonwealth Employment Service held unfilled<br>
vacancies for 42,100 males and 30,700 females, a rise of some 3,000 on<br>
the previous month, the total number of vacancies being over 100,000.<br>

PEACE.<br>
JAPAN-VISIT OF DR. EVATT.<br>
On 5th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" 1 have received the following message from the Supreme Commrander,<br>
Allied Powers ( General of the Army Douglas MacArthur):-<br>
Dr. Evatt has completed his visit to Japan and has sailed for home. It<br>
has been a source of pleasure and satisfaction to everyone to have had him.<br>
here. He has represented your country with skill and distinction and has<br>
added to its national prestige. He has been of marked assistance with regard<br>
to occupation problems and has made a distinct contribution to the furthering<br>
of a treaty of peace. It is needless to add that he lias rendered more. vivid<br>
the indissoluble ties of cordiality and friendship forged between our two<br>
rountries during our ( commlon struggle in the Pacific. Thank you for perinitting<br>
him. to comne.""<br>
On 12th August, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br>
Evatt) said-<br>
During my' visit to Japan-chiefly a fact-finding mission-I had<br>
full and frank discussions abrnut the occupation and the problems that<br>
will confront the Allies in writing the peace. I am satisfied that the<br>
way is clear to the making of a peace settlement that will be a stable<br>
foundation for the security of the Pacific.<br>
"" I had frequent discussions with the Supreme Commander, Allied<br>
Powers ( General MacArthur), and with leading officials of the occupation,<br>
diplomatic representatives of other Powers, ' and a few of the </p>
<p>Japanese parliamentary and trades union leaders. Fromn these discussions<br>
and personal observation I am able to ' appreciate still better<br>
the undoubted achievements of an extremely difficult and complex<br>
military occupation and administration. My consultations with<br>
General MacArthur showed a broad agreement on . the steps to by<br>
taken in preparing the treaty, on the principles that should be contained<br>
in it, on the type of supervisory , machinery that should bi<br>
established under it and on mnany of the other important matters with<br>
which the settlemcent must deal.<br>
"" It has been most encouraging to find that all my discussions and<br>
observations have amply confirmed the soundness of the policy that ' the<br>
Australian Government has consistently advocated towards Japan. The<br>
two great objectives are the security of Australia and other Allied<br>
Powers from a resurgence of Japanese aggression, and a positive programme<br>
for assisting Japan to develop gradually into a democratic<br>
and peaceful member of the society of nations. Almost equally important<br>
is the : metlhod of peace-making. The peace treaty should b:.<br>
negotiated as soon as possible along democratic lines by all powers<br>
that played I substantial part in the Pacific war. Because of her outstanding<br>
war effort, Australia is clearly entitled to be a party prinlpal<br>
to the settliement, and that : i now universally recognized.<br>
The military occupation has new almost accomplished its primary<br>
task, which w. as ie complete physical disarniamneut and deiiilitarizution<br>
of Japan. It has taken imlportant initial steps towards th.<br>
democratic reconstruction of Japnii, for example through the -adoption<br>
by the Japanese people of a inew constitution and the encouragement<br>
of trades unions. The peace. treaty could and should contain provisions<br>
destined to . ecure. the accomplishment of the long-term objeetives-<br>
to prevent any re-growthl of a vw. rr potential and to stial'uato<br>
and consolidate the growth of democracy in Japan. These problems<br>
will form the subject of discussions between members of the British<br>
Commonwealth on 26th August, 1947. That beginning will be followed<br>
by ai conference of all the Powers that took a substantial roll.<br>
in achieving victory in the Pacific war.<br>
I was greatly impressed by the bearing and behaviour of the<br>
Australian servicemen and the re'st of the B. C. O. F. in Japan. They<br>
have greatly assisted in the success of tin occupation and have demonstrated<br>
to Japan and the world at large Australia's major interest in<br>
the Pacific. The co-operation between the B. C. O. F. and the United<br>
States forces has strengthened an association and comradeship that did<br>
-o much for Australia during the crisis in the Pacific war.""<br>
JAPAN--ADVISORY COMMITTEE.<br>
On 12th August, 1947, the Advisory Committee on Japanese Settlement<br>
had its first meeting. Members of the committee , are-<br>
Sir Frederic Eggleston, chairman, the Solicitor-General ( Professor K. ' 1.<br>

JAPAN-BRITTSH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.<br>
On 16th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) advised Cabinet<br>
to-day that representatives of Britain, Canada, South Africa, New<br>
Zealand, India, Pakistan, Burma and Australia would meet at Canlierra<br>
on 26th August, 1947, to discuss the question of a peace<br>
; ettlement with Japan. The provisional agenda of the conference will<br>
loe procedural questions; basic objectives; control or supervision of<br>
Japan; territorial provisions; disarmament and demilitarization;<br>
political provisions; economic and financial provisions; and reparations.<br>
"" The general policy in relation to Japanese settlement may be<br>
summarized as follows:-<br>
There should be no delay in going ahead with the Japanese I'Paice Conference.<br>
In the absence of a peace settlement there will be increasing tendencies for<br>
iajor matters of permanent imlport. inc to be dealt with on a piecemejal basis or<br>
to be postponed.<br>
Auistrnliln'aw \\ a eltort entitled lier t-be rI: tog nized as n party principal in<br>
the peace settlement Australia lhis ealted this position by her war effort<br>
which, inl Celcr. ial MacArtlur's words. contributed inlcaslulrably towards<br>
I'acific victory.<br>
Australia accepts the democratic principle that despite their varying con-<br>
Iributions to the common victory all nations which played any substantial<br>
a:.; rt in the Pacific war should he represented at the peace conference.<br>
The voting procedure suggeste l by the United States ( that is, two-third<br>
irajority) is just and democratic and any attempt to apply the veto system<br>
would be unjust and must be resisted.<br>
The peace settlement for Japan need not be a long drawn out affair, but<br>
iuld be completed early in 1048. Indeed its fundamentals have already been<br>
:; ccepted in the basic policy formulated in the Far Eastern Advisory Commission<br>
; nd later confirmed in substance by the present Far Eastern Commission which<br>
was a development of the broad principles of the Potsdam declaration. The<br>
f: oundlations of the peace have also been laid through the constructive pioneer<br>
work already pierformed in Japan by General MacArthur, as a result of which<br>
military disarumaient is now practically completed.<br>
The basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission prescribed certain measures<br>
which were the physical disarmament of Japan. the removal of militarist and<br>
I'a: scist elements, the trial and punishment of war crimes and the destruction<br>
Japan'. capacity to wage war.<br>
The basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission also laid emphasis upon the<br>
i-sitive tasks of building a peaceful and democratic Japan. This called for<br>
reform of the social, political and economic life of Japan. For example, trade<br>
unions should be actively encourigel antd the educational ystcm liberalized.<br>
These positive tasks are necessarily lone-term in character.<br>
SThe settlement niust take account of South and East Asia and the Pacific<br>
t whole. A peace should be established in accordance with the objectives<br>
-f the United Nations Charter-a peace which should give security from future<br>
;., gression and at the same time help to raise the standards of living of all<br>
the peoples of South and East Asia and the Pacific. The gradual economic<br>
development of Japan should be part of a general plan for the economic betterment<br>
of East and South-East Asia and the Pacific as a whole. It would be<br>
injust if her population obtained privileges and benefits denied to the countries<br>
which she has devastated. </p>
<p>In order to achieve these objectives, an Allied supervisory authority should<br>
be established in the treaty of peace in order to consolidate the important<br>
gains already made and ensure a bona fide observance of the treaty provisions<br>
and especially to prevent any re-establislhment of a war potential. In addition,<br>
the supervisory authority should have as one of its functions, the co-ordination<br>
of the Japanese economy with those of the Pacific and East Asiatic regions.<br>
The futitre of . Japan depends first upon the determination of the Allied<br>
Power to pursue vigorously the objectives laid down by the Far Eastern Commission.<br>
and secondly upon the energy, sincerity and co-operation of the<br>
Japanese themselves in carrying out the great reforms already planned.<br>
The peace treaty should therefore lie not vindictive but just and firm.<br>
Australia desires to achieve hy demnocratic procedures of peace-making a<br>
stable and lasting peace in the Pacific based on security from aggression and<br>
the welfare of all Pacific peoples. This great objective will be assisted if tihe<br>
peace conference is expedited, thereby furnishing an example of Allied co-operation<br>
which should also assist in the final European settlement.<br>
Cabinet expressed satisfaction with the progress made in connexion<br>
with the Japanese peace settlement, as a result of Dr. Evatt's<br>
recent mission to Japan and gave approval to the general principles and<br>
purposes to be followed and the democratic procedures proposed for<br>
the peace settlement<br>
JAPAN-BRITISH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.<br>
On 26th August, 1947, the British Commonwealth conference met<br>
at Canberra. The following communiqu6s were issued:-<br>
August 26th: Discussions at the conference are of a pirovisionl icharacter<br>
and are for the ipurpose of exchanging views between ' the nations represented.<br>
The subjects to he discussed for this purpose will hei.<br>

9. Form of peace settlement ( one instrument or two; participation of<br>
Japan; coming into force; adherences.)<br>
August 26th: At the short afternoon session, there was . a general exchange<br>
of views on Peace Conference procedure including the system of voting. In<br>
the course of the discussion on the latter subject, views were expressed on the<br>
United States proposal that decision at the Peace Conference shlioul he by a<br>
two-thirds majority.<br>
The consensus of opinion was that the first meeting of the I'racte Conference<br>
should he held as soon as possible. It was also the general understaniding that<br>
the initial conference should be on a Governmental or policy making level.<br>
August 27th: To-day's sessions were devoted to an examination of the basic<br>
objectives of the settlement and the territorial provisions that should he incorporated<br>
in the peace treaty. Consideration of these problems was simplified by<br>
the existence of the statements made at Cairo, Yalta and Potsdam. Allied agreement<br>
on fundamental principles had also been reached on the basic policy and<br>
other policy decisions of the Far Eastern Commission.<br>
An examination of these documents shows that there will be no complicated<br>
frontiers to define in the Japanese Peace Treaty since Japanese territories are all<br>
insular. The Potsdam Declaration states specifically the ' Japanese sovereignty </p>
<p>shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such<br>
minor islands as we determine It will be for the Peace Conference to decide<br>
which of the minor islands shall remain under Japanese sovereignty.<br>
Against this background, the delegations exchanged views on certain strategic<br>
aspects of the changes proposed and on its effect on the economy of Japan and<br>
heard statements from the commander-in-chief of the British Commonwealth<br>
Occupation Force ( Lieutenant-General H. C. H. Robertson), the Assistant Undersecretary<br>
in the British Foreign Office ( Mr. M. O. Denning), the head of the<br>
Canadian diplomatic mission in Tokyo ( Dr. E. H. Norman) and the Australian<br>
representative on the Far Eastern Commission ( Major J. Plimioll) on the military,<br>
social, political and economic development of Japan under the occupation<br>
and on the prospects for the post occupation period. Stress was laid on the great<br>
contributions these territorial changes will make towards preventing a recurrence<br>
of Japanese aggression, as they will deprive Japan of vital military, naval and air<br>
bases and control of certain essential raw materials<br>
August 28th: The discussion of the disarmament and demilitarization of<br>
Japan was completed. Delegates expressed the view that Japan should remain<br>
completely disarmed and demilitarized, that all armaient manufacture should<br>
he forbidden. and that internal order should be maintained by a non-military<br>
police force.<br>
Conferenct exaimined in detail measures that might be necessary to ensure<br>
that the Japanese should not be permitted at present to conduct research in the<br>
field of atomic energy or to develop or use atomic energy.<br>
Complete prohibition of the building of any kind of naval vessels, as decided<br>
on by the Far Eastern Commission, and the limitations that should be imposed<br>
on the operation of Japanese commercial shipping confined to insular trade were<br>
discussed. Views were also exchanged on the question of the control to be exercised<br>
over the future of civil aviation in Japan. It was felt that manufacture<br>
of aircraft should be completely prohibited in Japan.<br>
Conference has devoted a great deal of time to the subjects of the disarmament<br>
and demilitarization of Japan because of their extreme importance in<br>
securing a stable peace in the Pacific.<br>
Conference considered the principles of the political provisions that should be<br>
incorporated in the Peace Treaty. It paid particular attention to the present<br>
Japanese Constitution which carried out many of the principles which the Allied<br>
Powers would like to see permanently in effect in Japan such as the guarantee of<br>
fundamental human rights.<br>
Among other subjects dealt with was the exclusion from public . office of<br>
persons who had been removed because of their ultra-nationalistic and<br>
militaristic affiliations, and Conference considered ways and means of continuing<br>
to exclude those who remained undesirable.<br>
Other subjects discussed were the Japanese Public Service, education, ultranationalistic<br>
societies, special police and para-military organizations. These<br>
subjects are already dealt with to some extent in the Potsdam Declaration and in<br>
the Basic Policy and other Policy Decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, and<br>
discussion of these subjects was, therefore, facilitated by the consideration<br>
already given to them and by the wide area of agreement that had already been<br>
achieved on these subjects among the eleven members of the Far Eastern<br>
Commission. Conference took note of the steps taken by the Supreme Commander and the<br>
Japanese Government to dissociate Shinto from the Japanese State. It was<br>
evident that the pre-war system of providing State subsidies for Shinto shrines,<br>
clergy, and organizations should not be resumed after the Treaty.<br>
Conference considered matters relating to treaties between Japan and other<br>
nations and the precedents set in the treaties with Italy and the satellite powers<br>
were carefully examined. In this connexion, Conference considered the question<br>
of the admission of Japan to the United Nations and the International Court<br>
and to such bodies as the Food and Agricultural Organization and the International<br>
Labour Office.<br>
It was suggested that Japan should renounce all rights and interests both<br>
public and private located outside Japan and that these would be expropriated<br>
by local administrations.<br>
Conference devoted attention to means by which Japanese who had<br>
co-operated with the occupation authorities would be given full protection against<br>
victimization after the Allied Forces were withdrawn. It seemed obvious that </p>

<p>On 2nd September, 1947, Dr. Evatt said<br>
"" We can look back on the week's work with great satisfaction.<br>
We have all worked together towards the attainment of our common<br>
aim, the establishment of a just and lasting peace in East Asia and<br>
the Pacific. It has been a great pleasure to preside over the first<br>
conference to include a new India, a new Dominion of Pakistan, and<br>
Burma. These states share the desire of all of us for freedom and<br>
democracy, and in their great tasks they will have the full support of<br>
all other members of the British Commonwealth.<br>
"" We came here as separate sovereign states to exchange views in<br>
order to understand more clearly one another's policies, rather than to<br>
commit ourselves to a specific solution to a great problem. But more<br>
important than mere formal agreements is the spirit which animates<br>
us all. We want a settlement that will be the basis for a stable peace<br>
in the Pacific, free from the threat of Japanese aggression. We want<br>
to encourage democracy in Japan. We do not desire to prejudice<br>
future peace by yielding to mere resentment and vindictiveness. The<br>
restrictions we desire to impose on Japan and its economy are those<br>
necessary in. the interest of security. In curbing effectively and permanently<br>
Japanese ability to wage war, we must at the same time leave<br>
her an outlet for peaceful development. But at the same time we have<br>
taken account of the difficulties of the peoples who suffered at Japanese.<br>
hands. The future of Japan is nlot an isohttc. d probem but onev wicli must<br>
be approached in relation to its neighbouring States : nd to the world<br>
as a whole. The solution can lie in a comprehensive international<br>
effort to raise standards of welfare throughout the whole of Southern<br>
and Eastern Asia and the Pacific. Japan must contribute her utmost<br>
towards raising those standards; and if she does so she will share in<br>
the improvement. Australia does not want Japan to become a starvation<br>
area in the Far East, nor does Australia want the Far East to be<br>
a starvation area in the rest of the world. In making the peace settlement,<br>
we should not devote our attention exclusively to the defeated<br>
nation. That is the basis for a realistic and, bholiev-., a statesima. alike<br>
peace. I believe that these views are shared by the United States, whose<br>
vast war effort contributed so much to winning the Pacific war, and<br>
by General MacArthur, under whose leadership the threat of Japanese<br>
invasion was flung back from Australia and the occupation of Japan<br>
successfully undertaken.<br>
The great desire of the peoples of the whole world to-day is peace.<br>
To-day there is neither war nor peace. Our efforts to establish a better<br>
international order, based on the United Nations, will be held back if we<br>
do not speedily make peace and conclude settlements which will form<br>
the basis for world recovery and development. The peoples of the<br>
British Commonwealth . and their Governments here represented are<br>
striving to bring about an early settlement with Japan based on justice<br>
and achieved by democratic methods."" </p>

SHIPBUILDING.<br>
DE-REQUISITIONING-OPERATION.<br>
On 7th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
General de-requisitioning of vessels now controlled . by the Commonwealth<br>
Government through . the Australian Shipping Board under<br>
the administrative direction of the Minister for Shipping ( Sennator<br>
Ashley) by power. s conferred upon National Security ( Shipping Coordination)<br>
Regulations will commence on 18th August. 1947. from<br>
which-date also increases in freight rates of Imany cirgi itrmnis<br>
will become operative. With some few exceptions, ships will be derequisitioned<br>
as they conic into position for re-delivery to owners. The<br>
exceptions will, for the present, include some intrastate shipping in<br>
respect to which negotiations are continuing.<br>
After the outbreak of war, a number of Australian passenger and<br>
other vessels were taken by the Government for : the direct use of the<br>
armed services, and the bulk of the remainder of the Australian Mercantile<br>
marine was requisitioned in 1941 under National Security ( Shipping<br>
Control) Regulations. The Shipping Control Board, appointed under<br>
the regulations, succeeded later by the Australian Shipping Board,<br>
was given wide powers to direct the trade in which the requisitioned<br>
vessels would engage, and to govern the rates of freight chargeable.<br>
In 1943, it was decided that close collaboration was essential with<br>
the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner in relation to freight rates<br>
and the shipping regulations were amended. With minor exceptions,<br>
the freight rates prevailing on 12th April, 1943, have remained<br>
unchanged. "". Since 1943 there have been heavy increases in costs under any<br>
headings and the Commonwealth Government, as part of its general<br>
plans for price stabilization, has met the difference between the<br>
revenues received and costs incurred in the chartering and operating of<br>
the requisitioned vessels. A review has been made to ascertain the<br>
extent to which the revenue from freights will require to be increased<br>
to enable shipowners to operate their vessels at a reasonable profit </p>
<p>level on the requisitioned vessels being released from control under<br>
National Security ( Shipping Co-ordina. tion) Regulations-and it is<br>
apparent that substantial freight increases are inevitable.<br>
The Government has decided to permit increases on a. large number<br>
of cargo lines . and to continue for the present a governmental subsidy<br>
on freights in respect to certain other goods. The freight increases,<br>
whether to be met by shippers directly or by the Government as<br>
subsidy, are very considerable. The extent of the increases-about<br>
œ 2,000,000 a year-cannot be stated in the foium of a percentage on the<br>
1939 rates or on the 1943 rates as they cover many different lines and<br>
vary with different trades.<br>
The schedule has been carefully worked out by government officers<br>
and shipowners in collaboration and the Government is satisfied that<br>
the additional rates approved and necessary to enable shipowers to<br>
pay their way and earn a reasonable profit on their coastal shipping<br>
operations. Owners have shown no anxiety to increase freights unnecessarily<br>
but are conscious of the competition, actual . and potential, from<br>
other forms of transport, and of the fact that costs cannot rise steeply<br>
without danger to their industry. Details of the approved increases<br>
and of the cargo items eligible for freight subsidy will be published.<br>
"" CSpecific increases which the Government will subsidize for the<br>
present include coal and sugar. Other items eligible, under certain<br>
approved conditions, for Government subsidy are breakfast foods,<br>
dried and processed fruit, invalid and infants' food, milk products, stock<br>
foods, textile and clothing ( excluding floor coverings and furnishings)<br>
and timber. These items are illustrations and the commodities named<br>
are subject to precise definitions.<br>
The Government will not subsidize limestone, barley, produce,<br>
steel products or general cargo not specifically provided for. The<br>
cargo items eligible for subsidy have been selected in relation to the<br>
Government's overall economic policy.<br>
The Government i. s giving no undertaking as to how long it will<br>
continue to contribute to the shipping freight costs of goods now designated<br>
as eligible for subsidy under approved conditions. The Government<br>
will also keep under review the general level of shipping<br>
freight rates with a view to revision if it should become apparent, after<br>
a reasonable period of experience, that this is necessary in the<br>
interests of shippers, shipping operators, or the national economy.<br>
"" In common with every other country, Australia suffered from<br>
tonnage shortages during the war -and since. The Australian coastal<br>
fleet has been augmented during the war by Australian-built ships and<br>
by tonnage chartered from Britain and other countries. It is still<br>
necessary to retain on charter a considerable number of British vessels,<br>
mostly engaged in the coal and bulk iron ore trades, and the local<br>
shipbuilding programme is continuing. </p>
<p>16<br>
"" Ships under the direction of the Australian Shipping Board<br>
including the requisitioned ship. s, have been operated as if they were<br>
, ne fleet. Traffic committees, on which government officers and represcntatives<br>
of the shipping companies met, considered total shipping<br>
resources in relation to cargo accumulations and the necessity for<br>
according priorities to most needed goods. A principal objective is<br>
to get full loads for ships and the necessity to use vessels to their<br>
utmost capacity naturally makes it extremely difficult to arrange for<br>
regular services and this movement will doubtless continue. Before<br>
deciding to de-requisition, coastal vessels, the Government has sought<br>
iissurances from shipowners that co-ordinated direction of traffic will<br>
continue while the necessity remained. Owners have volunteered full<br>
co-operative and assistance and a committee representative of owners<br>
and of the Comnmonwealt. h Directorate of Shipping will continue the<br>
overall direction of . hip. in relation to the country's needs.<br>
"" I pay tribute to the assistance received during the war years, and<br>
later, frcom the British Government. Australia contributed its resource.<br>
without reserve to the common pool and had been supported generously<br>
by the British Governent. Valued assistance at emergency<br>
periods had been given by thre United States War Shipping Administration.<br>
T can speak highly of the expert and willing assistance given<br>
to the Commonwealth Government by the Australian shipping cormpanies.""<br>

NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES.<br>
POLICY-MEDIATION.<br>
On 7th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) saidrefer<br>
to reports of an American offer to mediate in the Dutch-<br>
Indonesian dispute.<br>
The decision of the -Security Council was that the two parties<br>
should cease hostilities and then submit to arbitration or other peaceful<br>
means of settling the dispute. When that decision was taken by the </p>
<p>Security Council, it was interpreted by the Australian Government as<br>
meaning that the two parties would submit their case to an arbitrator<br>
who would give a decision which would be binding on the two parties,<br>
the arbitrator acting as an agent for the Security Council. Consequently,<br>
any offer merely of good offices does not adequately meet the<br>
situation. Reports are current that Republican authorities do not find mediation<br>
acceptable, nor do they find the good offices of only one country<br>
acceptable. While it is understood that the Netherlands Government<br>
had accepted the American offer, it must be accepted by both parties<br>
before negotiations can commence. It might be recalled that previously<br>
the Indonesians accepted the good offices of Britain, the United States,<br>
and Australia, which were put forward separately, but thise, at that<br>
time, were not acceptable to the Netherlands authorities.<br>
The present situation is full of dangers as, while there i. a truce,<br>
there is no negotiation or contact between the two parties, and incidents<br>
are likely to occur each day which might make negotiatin. more difficult.<br>
The period between the cessation of hostilities and the cnommnencement<br>
of negotiations should be as short as possible.<br>
"" If both parties consider it would help to terminate this interim<br>
period and to commence negotiations immediately, the Australian<br>
Government, for its part, will be prepared to act jointly with -the<br>
United States Government in a capacity of mediator and arbitrator.<br>
This offer is made in the spirit in which the Australian Government<br>
raised the matter in the Security Council-that is in a spirit of impartially<br>
and with only one desire, to see, as soon as possible, a peaceful<br>
settlement of the prolonged dispute in the Netherlands East Indies<br>
( For earlier references, please see No. 128, page 32.)<br>
CIVIL AVIATION.<br>
I. C. A. O.-REGULATIONS.<br>
On 8th August, 1947, the Minister fbr Civil Aviation ( Mr. Drakeford)<br>
announced that Australian air navigation regulations had been<br>
revised to bring them into line with the Chicago Convention, and to<br>
give effect to reconmmendations and decisions of the International Civil<br>
Aviation Organization created under that convention. The new regulations<br>
came into force on 10th August, 1947.<br>
SOUTH PACIFIC AIR TRANSPORT COUNCIL-SECOND<br>
MEETING.<br>
On 14th August, 1947, Mr. Drakeford said that the second meeting<br>
of the South Pacific Air Transport Council, which had concluded that<br>
day, had had as its chief task the policy for the conduct of British<br>
Commonwealth Air Services in the Pacific area and consideration of<br>
the reports of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines and Tasman<br>
Empire Airways Ltd. The Council had agreed to the composition and </p>
<p>functions of the Trans-Pacific Committee and the Trans-Tasman Cormittee<br>
and had drawn up directives which would govern Tasman Empire<br>
Airways and British Commonwealth Pacific Airways in the<br>
operation of their services. It was agreed that the companies should<br>
be left the greatest initiative in the day-to-day management of their<br>
affairs in line with the Government's over-riding interest in matters of<br>
major policy and finance.<br>
The meeting agreed that British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines<br>
Ltd. would begin its operations of the Trans-Pacific service early in<br>
1948 with the Skymaster aircraft already being operated on its ' behalf<br>
by Australian National Airways over the route. Arrangements were<br>
being made for orders to be placed for four Solent flying boats for<br>
Tasman Empire Airways.<br>
Council reviewed the fare on the air service between New Zealandand<br>
Australia and agreed that certain reductions should be made.<br>
Council received a report from the Australian delegation regarding<br>
the operation of regional services from Australia in the area to Fiji<br>
and West 1700 E. Regional services operated by New Zealand were<br>
still in the hands of the Royal New Zealand Air Force ' but it was<br>
expected that by 1st October, 1947, those services would be taken over<br>
by New Zealand National Airways Corporation.<br>
The rival claims of Nadi and Nausori as Fiji's international airport<br>
had proved a problem. A commission of the interested governments<br>
had been appointed to investigate the matter in Fiji in February,<br>
1948.<br>

INTERNAL ROUTES-INTRA-STATE SERVICES, PREMIERS<br>
DISCUSS.<br>
On 21st August, 1947, the conference of Commonwealth and State<br>
Ministers considered a submission by the Minister for Civil Aviation<br>
( Mr. Drakeford) requesting the State to consider afresh the question<br>
of expressly authorizing the Commonwealth instrumentality to engage<br>
in intra-state aviation on a permanent basis and asked those States<br>
that were unwilling to transfer full powers to authorize Commonwealth<br>
airlines to operate intra-state services under the same conditions<br>
as private operators. The Premiers explained the position in<br>
their respective States, but no agreement was reached on the proposal.<br>
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS, 1946-47.<br>
On 28th August, 1947, Mr. Drakeford said that in 1946-47 Australian<br>
airlines did record business.<br>
Passengers increased by almost 70 per cent. on 1945-46, while<br>
freight carried increased by 145 per cent. On internal air transport<br>
services 860,111 passengers were carried, nearly nine times the 1938-39<br>
total of 99,511. Total weight of freight carried was 12,247 tons, comnared<br>
with 693 tons in 1938-39. </p>
<p>BRITISII1-AUSTRALIA SERVICE---QANTAS, AGREEMENT.<br>
DIRECTORS.<br>
On 5th September, 1947, Mr. Drakeford announced that Messrs.<br>

WAR CASUALTIES.<br>
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.<br>
On 11th August, 1947, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford) said<br>
that the latest Royal Australian Air Force casualty list, containing the<br>
. names of seven personnel formerly reported missing and now presumed<br>
dead, would be one of the last of its kind. Only sixteen more cases of<br>
missing remained to be cleared up.<br>
PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br>
DAIRY INDUSTRY-MILK, STATES CONTROL.<br>
On 12th August, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" I have communicated with the State Premiers asking them t,<br>
resume control of mnilk prices from 1st October, 1947.<br>
"" In October, 1945, the Commonwealth provided producers with ; i<br>
guarantee of subsidy and prices. This afforded a stability to producers'<br>
returns during a difficult transitional period in. the industry<br>
and prevented increases in retail prices. In addition, special paymentls<br>
hlave been made to producers who experienced adverse seasonal conditions<br>
at various times. The total cost of maintaining stable retail prices<br>
in the last two years approximated œ 4,500,000.<br>
The sudden reineval of a subsidy of this niagnititlde ight cause al<br>
appreciable increase in the price of milk, which would be undesirabl<br>
not only because of the effect on the cost of living but also because it<br>
might reduce consumption of ai highly nutritional food. The Government<br>
has decided to continue a modified subsidy scheme to be operated<br>
by the States. The amount of subsidy available will be calculated at<br>
-4d. a gallon on milk consumed in metropolitan arias during the six offseason<br>
months of the year, and in country areas now receiving subsidy<br>
at two-thirds of present rates ( excluding drought relief). Present<br>
subsidy rate; vary considerably according to State locality and period<br>
of the year, but the new scheme represents overall a subsidy of about<br>
two-thirds of the old scale.<br>
"" The States will not be required to distribute the subsidy on any<br>
particular basis but can choose their own methods. The -only conditions<br>
are that the subsidy will be used for the benefit of consumers<br>
of whole milk and that a satisfactory control of prices operate in area'<br>
receiving the benefit of subsidy. The arrangement will operate for<br>
twelve months. </p>
<p>in all State.-, except Tasmania. milk buards have been established<br>
with authority to control the supply, distribution and price of milk<br>
in metropolitan areas. The action now taken will restore to those<br>
authorities their previous powers, and give the States an appreciable<br>
subsidy to cushion the effect of any price rises that may be necessary<br>
; s a result of the transition from Commonwealth to State control. As<br>
the amount of subsidy will be less than formerly, some price increases<br>
nay be necessary but the extent and duration of any price increases<br>
will depend on the method by which the subsidy is used by the States.<br>
The change-over has been timed to coincide with the ' flush' season<br>
in most States. v. hen siubs-idy payments are usually at the lowest<br>
levels."" ( For earlier references, please see No. 111, page 8; No. 123, page 4.)<br>
DAIRY INDUSTRY-CREAM CONTROL, RE-IMPOSITION.<br>
On 14th August, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)<br>
announced that a new Cream ( Disposal and UTTe) Order vould operate<br>
o( n 1st September, 1947.<br>
Under the new order, cream might be used only for the manufacture<br>
of butter and cheese at a registered or licensed dairy factory, at the<br>
farm where the cream was produced or under the authority of and in<br>
accordance with the terms and conditions of a permit. The use of<br>
cream for pastry cook and similar purposes would cease. Hospitals<br>
and like institutions and manufacturers of ice-cream should apply for<br>
a permit to obtain cream. Issue of permits to sick persons would be<br>
confined to persons suffering from duodenal or peptic ulcer, ulcerative<br>
colitis, or typhoid fever or other prolonged fevers, or active pulmonary<br>
tuberculosis. The Commonwealth Government had in mind an extra 3,000 to<br>
5,000 tons of butter for shipment to Britain and a quick survey of the<br>
quantities of cream being sold for use as such indicated that that<br>
quantity would be available if the public co-operated and did not seek<br>
ways and means of circumventing the restriction on the disposal and<br>
use of cream. ( For earlier references, please see No. 120, page<br>
POULTRY INDUSTRY-EGG CONTROL.<br>
On 15th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
"" Extension of the period of Commonwealth control over eggs<br>
to 31st December, 1947, was approved in May, 1947, to facilitate the<br>
formation of an Australian-wide Egg Marketing Organization.<br>
"" The Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) reported to Cabinet<br>
to-day on recent discussions of the Australian Agricultural Council.<br>
Cabinet approved the distribution of surplus funds resulting from the<br>
operations of the Commonwealth Egg Control scheme up to 30th June,<br>
1947, to the States, in the ratio in which egg producers in the various<br>
States have contributed them, for the purpose of investment in the<br>
proposed Aus. tralian Egg Equalization Committee Ltd. to provide the </p>
<p>margin of security necessary to finance the scheme; in the event of no<br>
Australian-wide company being formed the distribution of these funds<br>
to be further considered; and providing the respective State Egg<br>
Marketing Board with some working capital and subject to a careful<br>
review of the financial position the sum of œ 100,000 is named for this<br>
purpose. Cabinet also approved the transfer of any profit made by the<br>
Controller of Egg Supplies during the period 1st July-31st December,<br>
1947, to such authority ( Australian Egg Equalization Committee Ltd.)<br>
or authorities ( State Egg Boards) which have the responsibility for<br>
the marketing of Australian egg production subject to such funds being<br>
utilized for the maintenance of egg prices between January and June,<br>
1948. If the transfer is to be made to State Egg Boards the funds are<br>
to be allocated on the basis of production for the period 1st July-31st<br>
December, 1947.<br>
Cabinet also approved of the preparation of a bill to be submitted<br>
to the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party to establish an Australian<br>
Egg Board with powers to control exports, to buy and sell eggs and<br>
to ensure that the long term contract with the British Government is<br>
observed."" ( For earlier references, please see No. 116, page 6.)<br>
POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERIES.<br>
On 16th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Cabinet to-day considered a report by the Cabinet sub-committee<br>
on secondary industries on negotiations between the Commonwealth<br>
Government and the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. concerning<br>
grain alcohol distilleries.<br>
Cabinet approved of an agreement with the Colonial Sugar<br>
Refining Co. Ltd. for the purchase of certain plant at Cowra, New<br>
South Wales, and Warracknabeal, Victoria.<br>
"" Cabinet authorized the Secondary Industries Commission to<br>
arrange for the utilization by industry of land, buildings and remaining<br>
plant and equipment at the Cowra; Warracknabeal; Wallaroo, South<br>
Australia; and Collie, Western Australia, distilleries through the Commonwealth<br>
Disposals Commission, the Contract Board and the<br>
Department of the Interior.<br>
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-POULTRY.<br>
On 19th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-<br>
Australia will export œ A. 1,000,000' s worth of frozen poultry to<br>
Britain in 1947. In the first seven months of 1947 the entire 1946<br>
figure has been more than doubled, with 1,455 tons of -boiler fowls,<br>
587 tons of chickens, 446 tons of turkeys, 104 tons of ducks, totalling<br>
2,592 tons valued at œ A. 673,305. Allowing for the seasonal drop in<br>
the next three months, the estimate for the twelve months is 4,000<br>
tons."" </p>
<p>CANNED FRUITS.<br>
On 25th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-<br>
"" About 1,000,000 cases of canned fruits have been shipped by the<br>
Australian Canned Fruits Board to Britain from the 1946-47 pack,<br>
leaving 500,000 cases yet to be shipped. Australia had set aside the<br>
maximum quota of canned fruits for Britain during the current year.<br>
From the 1945-46 pack, shipments to the Ministry of Food were 977,300<br>
cases."" GIFTS.<br>
On 26th August, 1947, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron)<br>
said that food parcels which proved to be undeliverable in Britain were<br>
shipped back to Australia and returned to the senders. It had been<br>
agreed with the British Post Office that, in regard to future postings<br>
of gift parcels containing only foodstuffs or soap, those which proved<br>
to be undelivera'ble would be treated as abandoned parcels and the<br>
contents distributed to the best advantage.<br>
TALLOW.<br>
On 29th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-<br>
Approval has been given for the export to Britain of 250 tons of<br>
edible beef tallow and 250 tons of edible mutton tallow. This is in<br>
addition to shipments of oleo sterine, an edible fat, obtained in the<br>
manufacture of industrial margarine, which has been exported freely<br>
to Britain."" RABBIT SKINS.<br>
On 22nd August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that rabbit skin exports<br>
in 1946-47 were approximately three times greater in weight and<br>
fourteen times greater in value than in 1938-39. Exports of rabbit<br>
careases in 1947 would exceed pre-war figures.<br>
CANNED MEAT.<br>
On 25th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that nearly 40,000 tons of<br>
canned meat would be exported during 1947. The total included 25,000<br>
tons under contract to the British Ministry of Food, 1,500 tons supplied<br>
to the Red Cross and other relief organizations, 1,300 tons likely to be<br>
required for iil. rnuational relief, and 1,059 tons required for service use.<br>
leaving an estimated 11,000 tons for private export. The figures did<br>
not include canned meat sent in gift parcels to Britain, estimated at<br>
1,000 tons. The overall ceiling permitted by the Rationing Commission<br>
for canned meat production for 1947 was about 48,000 tons. The<br>
quantity left for local trade would be about 10,000 tons. Pre-war<br>
production of canned meat in Australia had never reached a third of<br>
the 1947 estimated total. </p>
<p>24<br>
SUGAR AGREEMENT, REVISION.<br>
On 4th September, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The Commonwealth Government has agreed in principle to the<br>
request recently made by the sugar industry for a variation in the<br>
Sugar Agreement to enable the wholesale price of sugar to be increased<br>
by œ 4 2s. 8d. a ton ( id. per lb. retail).<br>
"" I have consulted with the Premier of Queensland ( Mr. Hanlon)<br>
regarding the matter and we agreed to recommend to the respective<br>
Parliamentary Labour Parties that legislation be introduced for this<br>
purpose. "" The retail price of sugar in Australia has existed at 4d. a 1b.<br>
, apital cities since 1933, despite greatly increased costs of production<br>
in recent years. The increase in price will enable these increased costs<br>
to be met and will assist in rehabilitating the industry whose pro-<br>
, luction has fallen to low levels and whose capital equipment has greatly<br>
depreciated during the war.<br>
The increase in the wholesale price of sugar will allow retailers<br>
in additional 10s. 8d. a ton and wholesalers an additional Is. Sd. a ton<br>
profit. The increase in price will not take place until the Sugar Agreement<br>
has been signed between the two Governments and the Commonwealth<br>
Parliament has passed an amending Sugar Agreement Act.<br>
"" The temporary shipping freight subsidy on sugar will be with-<br>
Irawn when the increased price come into operation.<br>
There are other aspects concerning which I will have to consult<br>
with Mr. Hanlon before the revised agreement is finalized.""<br>

HOUSING.<br>
COMMONWEALTH-STATES AGREEMENT-COSTS AND<br>
STANDARDS.<br>
On 13th August, 1947, the Minister for Housing ( Mr. Lommon)<br>
released details of the report on State housing authority standards and<br>
methods prepared by the Deputy Director of Housing ( Mr. L. P. D.<br>
O'Connor), who undertook the investigation as a result of a decision by<br>
the Premiers Conference that an official should confer with each State<br>
to ascertain whether helpful suggestions of mutual benefit could be<br>
made to reduce costs of dwellings erected under the Commonwealth-<br>
States Housing Agreement. Mr. O'Connor had found that the main<br>
reasons for the present increased costs of Government sponsored housing<br>
iver pre-war were-<br>
Shortages of building materials, increased labour, increased costs of material!.<br>
reduced productivity of labour, time taken to complete dwellings, greater overhead,<br>
larger profits and lack of competition among contractor-s. </p>
<p>Mr. O'Connor suggested a number of economies in the construction<br>
practices of the States, the chief being-<br>
Reduction ini number of plan types, use of brick-on-edge for the inner leai<br>
' o external walls and for internal partitions, construction of brick veneer<br>
dwellings, . reduction in size of timber structural meimbcrs and elimination ( r<br>
front fences and side fences to building line.<br>
Dealing with disparities between the States in building costs of<br>
government-sponsored housing, Mr. O'Connor found that costs per<br>
square for an 1,100 square feet single-brick dwelling given for June.<br>
1947, by State housing authorities were-<br>
Sydney, œ 140; Melbourne, œ 132; Brisbane, œ 131; Adelaide. œ 110; Perth.<br>
Hobart, œ 112 ( timber-no brick dwellings being erected).<br>
The value of suggested economies according to States ranged downwards<br>
from œ 157 in regard to brick dwellings and from œ 112 downwards<br>
in regard to timber. Economies suggested by the Commonwealth to<br>
the States, if applied to the programme under the Commonwealth-<br>
States Housing Agreement for 1947-48 would, it was estimated, represent<br>
a saving of œ 1,400,000. The report stressed the need for constructing<br>
houses in large estates and letting contracts where possiblb<br>
for 500 houses at a time.<br>

TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT-PREPARATORY<br>
CONFERENCE, AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION.<br>
On 13th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
My attention has been drawn to a number of sta. tenents on whar<br>
the Australian Government has decided or may be expected to decide<br>
in the course of its consideration of the trade negotiations now proceding<br>
at Geneva. The position in regard to these negotiations is quite<br>
fluid. They have not yet reached the stage where it is practicable<br>
to assess the balance of possible trade benefits and concessions. </p>
<p>The Cabinet sub-committee is keeping in constant touch with the<br>
progress of the negotiations but in the circumstances has not yet formed<br>
even a tentative view as to possible recommendations to the Government.<br>
With regard to the negotiations with the United States, the Australian<br>
delegation, ha. s, in view of the offer of a reduction in the wool<br>
duty, been authorized to re-open negotiations. The Australian delegation<br>
has also been asked to furnish further information regarding<br>
the offers and responses on a number of other comnmodities. This has<br>
not yet been received.<br>
In the circinistuanes. any statements regarding the attitude of<br>

GOVERNMENT'S PLANS-REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,<br>
SNOWY RIVER REPORT.<br>
On 15th August, 1947, the Minister for Works ( Mr. Lemmon)<br>
released a report on the diversion of Snowy River. Mr. Lemmon<br>
said-Shortages of power exist in New South Wales and Victoria, and<br>
there is a need to provide for the rapidly increasing demand brought<br>
about by continuous industrial development. It could be met by exploiting<br>
the full potentialities of the . Snowy River and the costless reservoir<br>
, f snow which forms its source. If developed to its maximum, power<br>
for Victorian and New South Wales requirements can be ensured for<br>
many years to come, as well as furnishing water for an extension to<br>
r-xisting irrigation systems. Diversion of black coal to other States for<br>
general industrial purposes would then be possible.<br>
Fu! l power development is possible only if the Snowy River is<br>
diverted initially to the head waters of the Murray River, but the<br>
report points out. that it would be possible, if considered -advisable, to<br>
divert the water again from the lower Murray to the Murrumbidgee<br>
Valley for irrigation purposes.<br>
If this unique natural asset is developed to its fullest advantage,<br>
300,000 acres of intensely irrigated land can be served from the Snowy<br>
River, from which a gross annual return in the value of foodstuffs of<br>
at least œ 10,000,000 a year could be expected and, in addition, ultimately<br>
750.000 horse-power produced. If, on the other hand, the<br>
waters be diverted direct to the Murrumbidgee River the same amount<br>
of irrigation can be undertaken, but the power developed would be<br>
at least 500,000 horse-power less. To make up this power about<br>
1,300,000 tons of additional coal will have to be mined annually.<br>
"" From a commercial viewpoint the scheme would show profits of<br>
8 per cent. after providing for working expenses and depreciation.<br>
Thiø would he the expected dividend return if the scheme were to be </p>
<p>operated for profit, and would be a far higher yield than that shown<br>
by similar schemes run by utility companies here and overseas.<br>
"" The estimated cost of the Murray River diversion scheme, which<br>
includes a series of dams on the various tributary streams and on the<br>
Snowy and Murrumbidgee Rivers, with a tunnel 30 miles long under<br>
the Australian Alps to connect the Snowy with the Murray, and the<br>
electricity generating stations and power lines to Melbourne and Sydney<br>
with all equipment, may ultimately reach œ 65,000,000.<br>
On 20th August, 1947, the conference of Commonwealth and State<br>
Ministers decided-<br>
That a committee be constituted, consisting of two representatives<br>
from the Commonwealth and two each from the . States of New South<br>
Wales and Victoria, with power to co-opt such other assistance as<br>
may be needed from the three authorities, with a view to aaking a<br>
complete detailed investigation, the committee to report to a Premiers<br>
Conference as early as possible, but not later than twelve months hence.""<br>
"" I hope that the States will, at least, agree to proceed inumediately<br>
with the detailed investigation recommended. I feel that the report is<br>
so conclusive that it may well be accepted as proving the general<br>
feasibility and economy of the scheme, and that action may proceed<br>
immediately towards the diversion of the Snowy River to the Murray<br>
Valley, exploiting the waters to their maximum power capacity, without<br>
affecting the possibility of using them either in the Murray or Murrumhidgee<br>
Valleys to their fullest irrigation value.""<br>

On 15th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Clifley) said-<br>
A close watch is being kept by the Australian Government on all<br>
dollar imports, both United States and Canadian. The subject of<br>
sterling balances at London is being kept continuously under review.<br>

<p>FINANCIAL POLICY-CABINET DEC1. SONS.<br>
On 15th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said--<br>
Cabinet to-night surveyed the economic position as it affects the:<br>
United Kingdom and the position regarding dollar imports by Australia<br>
and Australia's sterling balances at London.<br>
Cabinet decided that there should be a severe rationing of thl:<br>
use of dollars for travel purposes and directed that a review be. made<br>
of dollar expenditure on tobacco, motion pictures, and all imports of<br>
a less essential character and a re-examination of the newsprint<br>
importations. Cabinet also decided that there should be an overall reduction<br>
in petrol consumption to save 4,250,000 gallons a month. The reduction<br>
will be applied to private users to effect a 20 per cent. to 25 per<br>
r. ent. reduction in their ration, a reduction of 20 per cent. to 25 per<br>
i: ent. in the ration of private business users, a 20 per cent. to 25 per<br>
t: cnt. reduction in the ration for pleasure boats and a 10 per cent.<br>
reduction in the ration for commercial users.""<br>
On 22nd August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Instructions have been issued to the Commonwealth Bank t,<br>
impose severe restrictions on dollars advanced to all travellers.<br>
The film industry has been asked to meet the Commonwealth<br>
( overnment on 26th August, 1947.<br>
I have been in communication with the newsprint pool authoritie<br>
and on 25th August, 1947, I will have a full review of newsprint<br>
imports fron the Customs Department.<br>
"" The Customs Department will present a full review of all dollar<br>
imports to Australia, including tobacco.<br>
"" There is no need for the British Government to make any specific<br>
requests for restrictions on dollar imports because the Australian<br>
Government has always kept a reasonable check on the use of dollars.<br>
This check will now be very severe.""<br>
On 2nd September, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Following consideration -of the latest develupments in the dollar<br>
crisis, Cabinet to-day decided on the following measures to reduce<br>
Australia's dollar expenditure.<br>
Motor Cha'sis.-A cut of the order of 20 per cent. is to be made<br>
in the number of chassis approved for importation during 194S as<br>
:' gainst the number approved for importation during 1947. The whole<br>
of this cut will be applied in the field of passenger car chassis and no<br>
reduction will be made in the chassis quotas for commercial vehicles.<br>
The detailed application of the cut to the various types of passenger<br>
car chassis is to be examined by an Inter'-departmental Committee on<br>
which the trade will be represented. The most severe restrictions will be<br>
imposed on chassis for cars in the higher price ranges with possible totnl<br>
exclusion of certain makes.<br>
Tobacco.-Import licences for American tobacco leaf are to Ix<br>
rut by 20 per cent. It is hoped that the reduction in releases of manufactured<br>
tobhcco and cigarettes will be limited to about 10 per cent. </p>
<p>Petrol.-Cuts were announced following the meeting of Cabinet on<br>
August, 1947, which were designed to achieve a saving of 10 to<br>
12 per cent. in current consumption. No further cuts are contemplated<br>
for the time being.<br>
Newsprint.-A reduction of the order of 30 per cent. is to he mad',<br>
in newsprint import programmes.<br>
Textiles.-Except for a few lines which are still in acute short<br>
supply, the issue of licences for the importation of textiles from dollar<br>
sources was temporarily suspended at the end of May, 1947. Cabinet<br>
decided that this policy should be continued for the time being pending<br>
complction of a comprehensive review of the supply position by the<br>
Rationing Commission.<br>
Aircraft.-Apart from aircraft already on order, no further purrbases<br>
of aircraft involving dollar expenditure will be authorized.<br>
Expenditure of dollars on spare parts for aircraft will also le closely<br>
supervised. Capital E'qipul i Me tad Ja-M. Ule-rials.-Machinery and other<br>
items of capital equipment are regarded as being in the highest category<br>
of priority and dollars will be made available to meet the essential<br>
requirements of Australian industry. In view of the present dollar<br>
crisis,: however, manufacturers will be expected to co-operate by<br>
exploring fully the possibilities of obtaining machinery from other<br>
-ources before they seek to import machinery involving dollar expenditure.<br>
The present method of dealing with applications for licences<br>
to import goods of this class is to be reviewed by an Inter-departmental<br>
(' onimittee. The committee will also examine the principles to be<br>
: dopted in dealing witl applications for licences to import raw materials<br>
from dollar sources of supply.<br>
Miscellhrncon Imports.-Aplart from the major items, Cabinet<br>
endorsed recommniendations by the Minister for Customs ( Senator<br>
( onrtice) for restrictions on a wide range of miscellaneous imports<br>
from the dollar area in accordance with the general objective of reducing<br>
. dollar expenditure on imports to the essential minimum.<br>
Film Re. utlti:' s.-Consideration is being given to the bemt mean.<br>
of reducing rlh dollar expenditure involved in remittances of film<br>
royalties to the extent of about 30 per cent.<br>
Travel EX: penditure.-Drastic restrictions wvill be imposed on the<br>
ount of dollars made available for personal travel and the allowance<br>
for businessmen will also be substantially reduced. As a corollary<br>
. further restrictions will be imposed on travellers taking out jewellery<br>
n. d other valuables as part of their personal effects.<br>
Remittances by Visiting Entertainers, Artists. cond the like.-Up<br>
to the present visiting entertainers and artists have been allowed to<br>
remit their net earnings in Australia without restriction. It is no<br>
longer possible to continue this policy and the Exchange Control<br>
iauthorities have been instructed to take steps to limit severely the<br>
. amount of. such remittances where dollars are involved."" </p>
<p>On 4th September, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator<br>
Courtice) announced the imposition of further restrictions on imports<br>
of goods from dollar areas. In future, licences would not be granted<br>
to import the following goods from countries in the dollar aarea:-<br>
Axes, dictating machines, human hair clipping machines, electric household<br>
ironing machines, clothes washing machines, computor mechanisms for use in<br>
the manufacture of petrol pumps, electric stoves, oil or spirit heating and<br>

FINANCIAL POLICY-SALE OF GOLD.<br>
On 5th September, 1947. Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Australia has sold 150,000 ounces of gold to the United Kingdom.<br>
"" I recall that during the depression Australia had to part with<br>
practically the whole of her gold reserves to enable her to meet her<br>
overseas obligations. During recent years the Commonwealth Bank<br>
commenced rebuilding a gold reserve by purchasing and holding current<br>
production. The Government and the Commonwealth Bank would have liked<br>
to continue the policy of gradually rebuilding Australia's gold reserve </p>
<p>but the current dollar situation is so serious that it has been decided for<br>
the time being to sell current gold production to the United Kingdom as<br>
a special measure of assistance in her present difficulties<br>

FINANCIAL POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH.<br>
On 20th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said*-<br>
We are living in a world that is in economic difficulties. I have<br>
been very anxious about the general world economic position for some<br>
years but the cituation lins deteriorated more rapidly than was expected.<br>
I told you yesterday in some detail about the economic position of the<br>
United Kingdom. We must not attempt to delude ourselves that, if<br>
economic difficulties occur in Britain and perhaps eventually in the<br>
United States, Australia will not be affected. That would be a sheer<br>
and complete delusion. The position overseas to-day is that the United<br>
States has been exporting, in terms of values, a vastly greater quantity<br>
of goods than it has been importing. Britain made the Anglo-American<br>
Loan Agreement, which bound it particularly in regard to the convertibility<br>
of sterling balances, in the hope that the American loan money<br>
would carry it on until 1950, by which time there would have been a<br>
large measure of rehabilitation in Europe and the British export trade<br>
would have been built up in hard currency countries as well as in<br>
sterling countries.<br>
A numiber of things have happened. First-a thing which I have<br>
always feared-in a world of rising prices in which people believe that<br>
some degree of inflation is desirable, the money that Britain borrowed<br>
from the United States is not able to bring in the quantity of goods that<br>
Britain expected. I think the British Prime Minister ( Mr. Attlee) said<br>
that instead of getting 100 per cent. volume his country has been<br>
receiving only 60 per cent. Associated with that fall in estimated<br>
production have been certain internal factors in the shape of unforseeable<br>
difficulties due to flood and cold.<br>
The rehabilitation of Europe has not progressed as the world<br>
hoped. In Europe to-day there is utter misery which must be unparalleled<br>
in the history of the world. At present the most strenuous efforts<br>
are being made to find some solution of this grave problem. It is<br>
becoming more and more apparent that we cannot have a prosperous<br>
Europe without a prosperous Germany, whatever our feelings in regard<br>
to Germany might be. One result of this disastrous situation is that<br>
the export market in Europe has not been restored because the countries<br>
of Europe have not the money with which to pay for exports. The<br>
dollar position has become more acute every day, particularly during<br>
the last few weeks-indeed, during the last few days. One of the main<br>
causes of this rapid deterioration in the situation is the problem of the<br>
At n cllnfrociic of Comnnmonwenlth und State Ministers. </p>
<p>convertibility of sterling, but there arc other factors with which I<br>
do not propose to deal now. Because of the difficulty of converting<br>
sterling currency some of the South American countries and certain<br>
Scandinavian countries are experiencing grave difficulties.<br>
The position of Britain, and to a lesser degree, the position of<br>
Canada, in regard to the dollar position has also deteriorated very<br>
considerably. I mention these matters to give you some idea of the<br>
present world situation, and without violating any confidences repos.:: i<br>
in me. Another factor to be considered is the large balances held in<br>
Britain by a number of countries, including Australia. The Australian<br>
balance is, of course, very small compared with those held by India.<br>
Egypt and even by Ireland. I know that many of us would prefer<br>
to live in a world of our own, but we cannot. My Government realizethat<br>
this difficulty cannot be cured in a day, but it may be possible to<br>
ameliorate the consequences of the developments.<br>
One of the immediate effects on Australia will be a serious curtailnient<br>
of imports, and that curtailment will apply not only to import<br>
from dollar countries, including Canada, but also, to some degree, to<br>
imports from sterling countries. However, if everyone plays the game.<br>
and works the right way I believe that the economy of this country is<br>
geared that it will be able to withstand the economic repercussions. Of<br>
course, I emphasize that the serious developments I have outlined may<br>
not eventuate, but we must realize that we shall probably have to go<br>
without many of the imports we had hoped to receive. For that reason.<br>
L wish ' to play safe' in the plans we are making for the immediate<br>
future. 1 warn conference that shniold these developments eventuate<br>
it will be absolutely impossible for us to continue as we have in the past.<br>
"" At the same time, I do not want anyone to go away with the<br>
impression that I do not firmly believe in the future of Australia.<br>
With prcper determination on the part of the governments and pttopli<br>
of Australia, I am sanguine that there will be a vast expansion. r<br>
may be altered for a while, but I have a deep-rooted confidence-shared<br>
by industrialists and husiinessmen, nanv of whom a re not of myv<br>
political faith-that Australia can obtain maxiimum production and<br>
economic staibilit MERCANTILE MARINE.<br>
SAFETY AT SEA.<br>
On 15tlI August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" In 1929, a conference on safety of life at sea was held at London<br>

and-the DepaFtment of Housing anticipates an acceleration of tho<br>
present building programme, probably 100 houses in the next six<br>
months, and ultimately reaching 300 to 500 h-ouses in a year.<br>
Cabinet approved of the allotment of a quota of one in each ten<br>

not in Government employ, the quota to be reviewed at the end of the<br>
year. Fifty pcir cent, of the quota will be allotted to ex-servicemen""<br>

5691.-2 </p>
<p>"" The Australian Performing Right Association has recently notified<br>
the Comnmonwealth Clothing Factory that, in respect of music<br>
rebroadcast to employees while at work, an annual licence will in<br>
future be required.<br>
"" Under an award in 1938, the Australian Broadcasting Commission<br>
pays to A. P. IR. A. an annual sum of 6d. a listener's licence in respect<br>

Commercial Broadcasting Stations pays to A. P. R. A. about the same<br>

to make a more satisfactory arrangement have been unsuccessful<br>
and no provision exists whereby A. P. R. A. can be coompelled to submit<br>

operation until 31st December, 1947, about 59 sets of regulations. 61<br>
separate regulations in the General and Supplementary sets and<br>

survey indicates that it will be poosible either to repeal or to<br>
allow to elapse before the end of the year about one-third of each class.<br>
However, it is probablc that all regulations of any significance in<br>
force in 1947 will need to have their effect carried forward in 1948.<br>
The general inflationary conditions present at the end of 1946 are not<br>
likely to have changed by the end of 1947, and control over economnic<br>
conditions generally will need to be continued. </p>

<p>MAN-POWER.<br>
WOMEN WORKERS-MINISTER'S REQUESTS.<br>
On 26th August, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)<br>
said that employers could provide greater opportunities for the parttime<br>
employment of women. Many employers were operating schemes<br>
for the part-time employment of women. Some schemes had been<br>
introduced during the war and others more recently. It had sometimes<br>
been found necessary to make internal adjustments to permit of the<br>
working of short shifts or to earmark certain types of work for parttime<br>
workers, but when those adjustments had been made a smoother<br>
flow and greater production had resulted from the increased numbers<br>
of workers. Women, not at present employed, should undertake part-time work.<br>
The total number of women in employment as wage and salary earners,<br>
excluding rural and household domestic workers, was about 620,000,<br>
or only 20,000 -below the peak war-time level, when man-power controls<br>
were operating. When account was taken of the greater numbers of<br>
women now occupied as employers or self-employed persons, it was<br>
very likely that the total number of women gainfully occupied was<br>
nearly as great as it was at the peak of the war.<br>
Decentralization of industry throughout suburban areas and the<br>
country meant that opportunities for employment were very much more<br>
handy to women living at home than previously. Arrangements could<br>
often be made to make part-time employment fit in with household<br>
and other commitments. JUDICIARY.<br>

during 1947-48. The receipts of the sinking fund for 1946-47 were<br>
about œ 25,950,000. The annual report covering these transactions will<br>
be presented to Parliament in due course.<br>
"" Receipts for 1947-48 are estimated at œ 26,873,000, being<br>
œ 17,625,000 on account of the Commonwealth and œ 9,248,000 on account<br>
of the States. Of the latter amount, œ 1,642,000 will be provided from<br>
Commonwealth revenue. The total contributions estimated to be available<br>
for the redemption of the debt of each . State are as follows:-<br>
New South Wales œ 3,612,000, Victoria œ 1,837,000, Queensland œ 1,340,000,<br>
South Australia œ 1,141,000, Western Australia œ 1,007,000, and Tasmania<br>

uses its funds for the redemption of Commonwealth and State<br>
securities either by repurchase of these securities on the market, or by<br>
redemption at maturity.<br>
"" The large sums applied in repurchases on -Stock Exchanges ensure<br>
a regular market for security holders. When securities are acquired by<br>

HEALTH AND YOUTH WELFARE.<br>
CHILD HEALTH.<br>
On 2nd September, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" Cabinet decided to-day on the recommendation of the Minister for<br>
Health ( Senator McKenna) that a division of child health be created<br>
in the Department of Health to be transferred subsequently to the<br>
National Health Service.<br>
The functions of the division will be to co-ordinate and extend<br>
existing pre-natal and infant welfare services; to continue research into<br>
the growth and development of infants and children, malnutrition and<br>
other diseases in children and related fundamental biochemistry and<br>
physiology; to conduct general education on infant and child health,<br>
including nutrition; to arrange, and if necessary, undertake special<br>
instruction to medical graduates and others in child health and<br>
nutrition. "" For the present the division will be located in the Institute of<br>
Anatomy, Canberra, and the functions of the division will be additional<br>
to those for which the Institute was founded-investigation of the<br>
anatomy and physiology of Australian animals and the development<br>
and maintenance of a museum of health and hygiene.<br>
"" Additional permanent positions will be created of a second medical<br>
officer to be an assistant to the Director; a senior biochemist to take<br>
charge of the increasingly important phase of the study of growth and<br>
nutrition; a second biochemist; and a nutritionist </p>
<p>INCOME TAX.<br>
UNIFORM TAX-RE-IMBURSEMENT TO THE STATES.<br>
On 2nd September, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
Under the war-time uniform tax scheme which operated until<br>
June, 1946, tax re-imbursement grants paid to the States amounted<br>
to œ 34,255,000. At a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers<br>
in January, 1946, it was agreed that a revised basis should operate as<br>
from 1st July, 1946. The revised basis was contained in the States<br>
Grants ( Tax Re-imbursement) Act and provided that the aggregate<br>
of the grants in 1946-47 and 1947-48 should be œ 40,000,000. In respect<br>
of subsequent years, it was specified that the aggregate grant of<br>
œ 40,000,000 would be varied in proportion to variation in the States'<br>
populations and the resultant amount increased by half the percentage<br>
increase, if any, in the level of average wages per person employed over<br>
the level in 1946-47. In regard to grants in years after 1947-48, the<br>
legislation provided that a gradually diminishing part of the aggregate<br>
grant would be distributed in the proportions in which the aggregate<br>
grant of œ 40,000,000 was distributed to the States in 1946-47 and<br>
1947-48, while a gradually increasing part would be distributed in<br>
proportion to the States' respective populations after adjustments had<br>
been made to those populations to take account of relative sparsity of<br>
population and the numbers of children aged five to fifteen years in each<br>
State. "" At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in<br>
August, 1947, the State Premiers indicated that the re-imbursement<br>
grants would be insufficient to enable them to balance their Budgets in<br>
this financial year.<br>
Cabinet decided to-day that an additional re-imbursement grant of<br>
œ 5,000,000 be distributed by the Commonwealth and the States as<br>
follows:-In 1947-48 the additional grant of œ 5,000,000 will be distributed among the<br>
States in accordance with the proportions in the first schedule to the States<br>
Grants ( Tax Re-imbursement) Act 1946.<br>
To the extent that, in subsequent years, the aggregate grant determined and<br>
distributed among'the States in accordance with the provisions of the States<br>
Grants ( Tax Re-imbursement) Act 1946 is less than œ 45,000,000, the amount<br>
of this deficiency will be made up by the Commonwealth and distributed among<br>
the States in accordance with the proportions in the first schedule to the Act<br>
of 1946. "" Legislation to authorize the payment of the additional grant will<br>
be submitted to the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party"".<br>
THE GOVERNMENT.<br>
On 5th September, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" The Minister for Health and Social Services ( Senator McKenna)<br>
will act as Attorney-General and I will act as Minister for External<br>
Affairs as from to-day and during the absence overseas of Dr. Evatt<br>
By Authority: L. F. JOHNSTON, Commonwealth Governrqent Printer, Canbenra. </p>

ASSESSMENT BILL, 1947-INSTALMENT SCALES.<br>
On 13th June, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
"" Regulations under the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Social<br>
Services Contribution Assessment Act have been gazetted to-day.<br>
These regulations prescribe reduced scales of instalment deductions<br>
to be made by employers from the weekly salary or wages paid to<br>
employees on and after the 1st July, 1947. The reduced scales give<br>
effect to the reductions in income tax and social services contribution<br>
rcnntly paced by Parliament. </p>
<p>As in the past, one scale has been printed by the Taxation Dleparl.-<br>
ment to cover instalments for both income tax and social services contributions.<br>
Copies of this scale will be available to employers before<br>
1st July, 1947.<br>
Some variation has been made in the form of the printed scale to<br>
be used. In cases of employees with dependants, the scale at present in<br>
operation provides for instalments according to the number and class<br>
of. dependants maintained. In the new scale, the instalments for such<br>
empl. yees are varied according to the total amount on which rebate may<br>
be claimed by the employee in respect of dependants. This alteration<br>
will simplify the application of the scale by employers. A copy of the<br>
scale is attached.<br>
The regulations contain provisions which will enable farmers,<br>
businessmen and other taxpayers from whose income instalment deductions<br>
are not made, to obtain the benefit of the reduced incomne tax and<br>
, ocial services contribution rates in the provisional amounts payable by<br>
them in respect of the income of the year ending 30th June, 1948.<br>
"" Normally, the provisional tax and contribution payable by such a<br>
taxpayer would be equal to the income tax and social services contribution,<br>
respectively, assessed for the financial year 1946-47. However, in<br>
view of the fact that the rates of income tax and social services contribution<br>
for the financial year 1947-48 will be lower than those for the<br>
financial year 1946-47, the regulations provide for a reduction in the<br>
provisional tax and contribution otherwise payable for the financial<br>
year 1947-48. Broadly, in cases where the taxpayer will be liable to<br>
both income tax and social services contribution, the reduction will le Is.<br>
in the œ 1 for each œ 1 of the taxable income derived by him during the<br>
year ending 30th June, 1947. In other cases, the reduction will be<br>
graduated up to a maximum of Is. in the œ 1 for each œ 1 of the taxable<br>
inconie derived by the taxpayer during the year ending 30th June, 1947.<br>
The regulations also prescribe the metals to which section 23 ( p)<br>
the Act shall apply. Section 23 exempts income derived by a<br>
bona fide prospector from the sale, transfer or assignment by him of his<br>
rights to mine for gold and for such metals and minerals as arc prescribed.<br>
The metals prescribed for the purpose of this provision are<br>
antimony, arsenic, beryllium, bismuth, cobalt, copper, mercury, molybdenuin,<br>
nickel, tin and vanadium.""<br>

FISHING INDUSTRY.<br>
WHALING-AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.<br>
On 9th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" On 20th November, 1945, Cabinet approved of proposals for Australian<br>
participation for whaling in the Southern Hemisphere. Since<br>
then an officer of the Fisheries Division of the Department of<br>
Post-war Reconstruction has attended an International Whaling </p>
<p>Conference. An inter-departmental conunittee, representing the<br>
Departments of the Treasury, Labour, Commerce, Supply and<br>
Shipping, Post-war Reconstruction and Repatriation has considered<br>
the general prospects of the industry. and particularly<br>
in the light of information received from Britain that the delivery<br>
of a factory ship would not ' be made until 1950 at the earliest.<br>
It was considered that Australia's initial entry into the industry<br>
should be through land stations and that, when they had been<br>
established and personnel trained, consideration could be given to<br>
pelagic operations.<br>
The Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) informed Cabinet to-<br>
( lay that the present position was that the building of a factory ship<br>
could not he completed until 1950 and that the proposal to secure a<br>
factory ship as part of Japanese reparations was being investigated by<br>
the Department of External Affairs but, even if aproved, there would<br>
he delay in delivery. It appeared that the Australian industry should<br>
be developed on shore-based operations from the New South Wales and<br>
Western Australian coasti and by pelagic operations based on Hobartthe<br>
latter being subject to personnel being trained at the land stations<br>

CZECHOSLOVAKIA. CREDIT.<br>
On llth June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" A credit of œ stg. 500,000 has been granted to the Government of<br>
Czechoslovakia through the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the<br>
purchase of Australian wool. The period of the credit is one year.<br>
Repayment has been guaranteed by the Government of Czechoslovakia.<br>
. It is ! a condition of the agreement that Czechoslovakia will make cash<br>
purchases of Australian wool to a value at least equal to the amount of<br>
the guaranteed credit.<br>
"" Before the war, Czechoslovakia was becoming an increasingly<br>
important buyer of Australian wool. It is considered that the credit<br>
will assist in the early re-establishment of the woollen industry in<br>
that country."" DEFENCE.<br>
POST-WAR-UNITED STATES CO-OPERATION.<br>
On 11th June, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)<br>
and the United States Ambassador ( Mr. Butler) said-<br>
The Commander-in-Chief of the United States Navy, Army and<br>
Air Forces in the Pacific area ( Admiral L. E. Denfeld) has had discussions<br>
with the Australian Government and service authorities on </p>
<p>7<br>
matters of mutual interest in the Pacific. The purpose of his visit was<br>
to ensure the continuance of the close co-operation between the United<br>
States and Australian services which existed through the war period<br>
and which contributed so much to victory in the Pacific.<br>
There is a practical identity of Pacific interests and excellent relationships<br>
existing between the United States and Australia. The discussions<br>
Admiral Denfeld has had with the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br>
Chifley), the MAinister for External Affairs, the Minister for the Navy<br>
( Mr. Riordan), and service authorities have covered mutual interests<br>
of the two countries in the Pacific, and it is natural that such discussions<br>
should be repeated from time to time. They are the natural<br>
outcome of the close association between the two Governments which<br>
characterized the war period and, being purely defensive in character,<br>
are completely in accord with the principles and purposes of the<br>
United Nations. The discussions during the last few days in Australia<br>
have been entirely successful from ail points of view.""<br>

PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br>
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-BRITISH POLICY.<br>
On 12th . June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The policy of the British Government on foodstuffs so far . as Austr:<br>
lia is concerned is to import the maximum quantities of basic foodtruffs.<br>
such as dairy products and meat, from us. Britain wants many<br>
othpr product. in addition to these basic lines including-<br>
IT! onlto pur chutney. apple butter, vilegar, bonox, vegemite, fruit juices,<br>
e mined meat and vegetables, canned steak and vegetables, canned rabbit, canned<br>
poultry, fricassee of poultry, fri,;-' nec of rabbit, fricassee of mutton, steak and<br>
kidney pudding. and irish stexx.<br>
: Britain do( s nor want certain foodstuffs in a processed form<br>
Ilc-ausicf sli prefers tine raw iaterials. She does not want plum pudlings,<br>
for instacce, from Australia, if she can obtain the flour, dried<br>
fruits and fats in bulk and use these items to the best advantage.<br>
Australia has been cognizant of the British Government's decision<br>
lto irstrict rlth import of certain processed and semi-luxury foodstuffs.<br>
It li; s beli tl.. policy of the British Ministry of Food to import food<br>
stiifs in pIarticnlar formns so that the Ministry may implement its rationig<br>
seljiinm. Kiinoing the position of Britain, the Australian Governmient<br>
hi,-nei'. and will continue to do, everything possible to shift<br>
the maxirinunl foodstuffs to Britain. The British import policy on food<br>
is the concern of tihe British Government.<br>
Australin has serious problems for tinned plate supplies and does<br>
not always desire to send goods in cans which can be exported in bulk.<br>
Australian exports to Britain of goods which are subject to import<br>
restrictionLs are not appreciable and make very little impression on the<br>
iquantity of foodstuffs required by the British Ministry.""<br>
DAIRY INDUSTRY-CONTROL.<br>
On 2nd July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The Australian Dairy Produce Board was set up in October, 1924,<br>
, nil consists of seventeen members appointed under the Dairy Produce<br>
Export Control Act. The members comprise-<br>
Four producers. iine representatives of butter and cheese factories, two<br>
representatives of prdprietary and privately-owned butter and cheese factories,<br>
inc representative of the Australian Council of the Australian Institute of Dairy<br>
Factory Managers and Secretaries, and one representative of the Commonwealth<br>
Government. During the war, the board's activities were curtailed and under<br>
National Security Act regulations, control of . the industry was taken<br>
over in November, 1939, by a small committee vested with wide powers.<br>
Cabinet decided to-day that legislation be prepared to amend the<br>
Dairy Produce Control Act to provide for a board of twelve members,<br>
with a ' Government nominee as chairman; to be vested with such additional<br>
powers and functions as might be necessary in the light of circumstances<br>
now obtaining in the industry. It is proposed that, when<br>
the new legislation operates, National Security Act regulations will be<br>
withdrawn."" </p>
<p>DAIRY INDUSTRY-MILK, SUBSIDIES.<br>
On 18th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
"" A decision as to the future control of milk will be made by the<br>
Commonwealth Government in September, 1947. The decision to be<br>
made is whether the Commonwealth should take any further interest<br>
and step out, or whether control should be handed to a State or local<br>
authority. If subsidies are discontinued by the Commonwealth, that<br>
will mean substantial increases in milk prices to consumers. One of the<br>
Commonwealth's difficulties is that at places such as Hobart and Launceston<br>
there is no authority to which the Commonwealth can hand<br>
control."" AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY-EXPORT CONTROLLED.<br>
On 3rd July, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)<br>
announced that controls would be exercised over the export of essential<br>
agricultural machinery to ensure that the greatest possible volume<br>
would be available in Australia. Types involved were--<br>
Tractors, grain and fertilizer cu! tivator drills, and seed drills for cereal crops,<br>
header harvesters. rezaper threshers, reapers and hinders, hay balers, side delivery<br>
rakes, mowers and spare parts.<br>
Token overseas shipments would be permitted as the nucleus of trade<br>
must be preserved.<br>
AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL MEETING-DECISIONS.<br>
On S1st Jily, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that a meeting of Anstralian<br>
Agricultural Council had been held. Decisions were-<br>
3IARKETING O I-I; GS.-At its last meeting. cotincil adopted recotniimei( ldtioiis<br>
embracing the formation of the Australian Egg E. qualization Conmmittee Limited<br>
for the marketing of eggs. The Standing Conmnittee on Agriculture now<br>
reported that unless the neces-iry legislation could be passed in New South<br>
Wales and Victoria to enable the company to operate as from It January,<br>
1S! 48, there would he disorganization in marketing and a fall in prices. Dealing<br>
with the question of surplus funds from Commonwealth egg control, Council<br>
expressed the view that the Commonwealth Government should be informed that<br>
some portion of the fund should be distributed as working capital of tile Australian<br>
Egg Equalization Committee Limited.<br>
BABLEY.--Proposals for the future marketing of barley, previously agreed to<br>
by representatives of Victorian and South Australian Governments and growers,<br>
and trading interests in those States, were adopted by council. The proposals<br>
provide for marketing barley under a pool system operating under State legislation<br>
without any guaraniitee of price: growers in effect receiving the average<br>
return obtained by the pool. Council decided that draft legislation prepared by<br>
the South Australian Government be considered by a conference of Commonwealth.<br>
Victorian and South Australian legal officers and that the draft bill<br>
then be submitted to the Commonwealth Government for approval and preparation<br>
as a Commonwealth Bill. The measure is to cover marketing of barley in<br>
Victoria and South Australia and any other States prepared to participate.<br>
ToBAcco.-Council adopted a tentative outline of Commonwealth and State<br>
legislation embodying principles considered necessary for a tobacco marketing<br>
scheme. The proposals envisaged a central authority charged with appraising<br>
tobacco leaf submitted to it under complementary State legislation. It would be<br>
necessary for the States to invest the central authority with necessary powers to </p>
<p>11<br>
appraise Australian tobacco leaf and allocate leaf to manufacturers. The legislation<br>
would provide for a table of limits which would be used to appraise leaf<br>
and should prohibit transactions except in accordance with the requirements of<br>
State Acts.<br>
POTArOEs.-Council noted that the Commonwealth had decided to continue<br>
the contract system with potatoes to cover the 1947-48 crop. The area desired<br>
was 185,000 acres calculated to give production sufficient to supply the population<br>
of Australia with 2j lb. of potatoes a week throughout the year with a margin<br>
of safety. It was proposed to allocate the area for 1947-48 as follows:-New<br>
South Wales-31,533 acres; Victoria-66,347 acres; Queeneland-17,735 acres;<br>
South Australia-7,880 acres; Western Australia-7,823 acres; Tasmania-<br>
54,149 acres; Total-185,467 acres.<br>
Basic price for best varieties of No. 1 grade was being raised from œ 12<br>
to œ 13 10s. a ton to cover increased costs arising from the removal of the subsidy<br>
on cornsacks and other increases. Council was informed that the existing<br>
scheme would not be extended after the season ending 1948 and stressed the<br>
necessity for all State legislation to be ready for operation before that date.<br>
SOIL CONSERVATION.-Council decided that, recognizing the importance of rye<br>
corn in soil conservation in Australia, immediate steps should be taken to build<br>
up in the Commonwealth a comprehensive collection of the world's rye corn<br>
varieties. Council recommended that a duly stubble mulch farm machine set be<br>
imported and made available to the New South Wales Conservation Service for<br>
testing as to efficiency.<br>
FERTITIzaER.-Council adopted recommendations from the conference of Commonwealth<br>
and State fertilizer officers as follows:-<br>
Sulphate for 1947-48 would be allocated to each State in the same proportion<br>
as in 1946-47.<br>
Nitrate of soda for 1947-48 would be allotted as follows:-New South Wales-<br>
1,100 tons; Victoria-1,100' tons; Queensland-2,000 tons: South Australia-<br>
450 tons: Western Australia-1,000 tons; Tasmania-350 tons; Total--6,000<br>
tons. Superphosphate supplies would be similar to the 1946-47 period-1,250,000<br>
tons. Potash supplies would be ample through commercial channels. Accordingly<br>
, upplies would not be allocated between the States for 1947-48.<br>
INSECT PEST CONTROL.-Council agreed to recommendations by the Standing<br>
Committee on Agriculture that a trial plan against plague locusts be undertaken<br>
in New South Wales.<br>
STocK DlsEASEs.-Recommentdations to council . by a conference of Commonwealth<br>
and State veterinary officers on control of stock diseases were approved<br>
as follows:-In view of the serious position developing in connexion. with ayian tuberculosis,<br>
poultry slaughtering should be subject to inspection under<br>
veterinary control in all States.<br>
Tuberculosis-free herd schemes should be uniform. Schemes in operation<br>
in New South Wales and Victoria, with agreed amendments to be accepted<br>
as a guide.<br>
Disease of Poultry.-Pullorum-free flock schemes were desirable in each<br>
State and those in operation should be used as a basis by States preparing<br>
echemes. An organized investigation into Birdsville and other related diseases of<br>
horses be conducted by the Council for Scientific and Iudustrial Research in<br>
conjunction with the Departments of Agriculture of Queensland, South<br>
Australia and Western Australia and the Northern Territory Administration.<br>
In the event of private institutions preparing living canine distemper<br>
virus vaccine, it should be controlled by requiring it to be issued only to<br>
veterinary surgeons.<br>
As penicillin was widely required for the treatment of bovine mastitis<br>
and other diseases, any restrictions on the issue of penicillin for veterinary<br>
use should be abolished. </p>
<p>VEGETABLE OIL PLA. NTS.-Council was informed by the Standing Committee onl<br>
Agriculture that it had considered the report of the Commonwealth mission<br>
which visited the United States in 1946 to inquire into the soybean industry:<br>
The committee informed council that it had accepted recommendations as<br>
fnllows:-Commonwealth and State Governments should take energetic action to<br>
promote the economic production of vegetable oil plants in Australia.<br>
The Commonwealth and States should set up a Vegetable Oils Committee<br>
to recommend broad policy on vegetable oil production to the council. Funds<br>
should be made available to undertake an intensive programme of plant<br>
breeding and selection and testing of soybeans and the vegetable oil producing<br>
plants appropriate to their environment.<br>
The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should undertake investigation<br>
into the industrial uses of vegetable oils. To allow manufacturers to<br>
exploit the possibilities of soybean oil, permits be issued for the importation<br>
of soybeans. MIGRATION.<br>
OVERSEAS OFFICES.<br>
On 12th June, 1947, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)<br>
announced that nine new Australian immigration offices would be<br>
opened as soon as arrangements could be completed at Oslo, The Hague.<br>
Paris, Berlin, San Francisco and New York, Shanghai, New Delhi and<br>
Cairo. The offices would deal with all migration matters, including<br>
official migration schemes, and the handling of landing permits, passports<br>
and the like. Duties of the offices at San Francisco and New<br>
York would include reception of applications and selection for the<br>
Government's new assisted passage scheme for United States ex-service-<br>
NATIONAL ECONOMIC PLAN.<br>
SALES AND TRANSFERS OF LAND-ADMINISTRATION.<br>
ROYAL COMMISSION.<br>
On 13th June, 1947, the Attorney-Genera! ( Dr. Evatt) announced<br>
that Judge Kirby, of the New South Wales District Court, had been<br>
appointed a Royal Commissioner to inquire into and report on certain<br>
matters arising out of the administration of land sales control. Terms<br>
of reference were-<br>
Whether there was misconduct or wrulg-doig on the part of any person in<br>

by the Sydney Land Sales Control office of the Department of the<br>
Treasury, or the Canberra Land Sales Control office of that department:-<br>
The transactions submitted for the Treasurer's consent by or on behalf<br>
of Stanley Evan Parry, Edward Richard Courtney McCormac, Sub<br>
. division Estates and Land Pty. Ltd., Burke Naughton Pty. Ltd., and<br>
Australian Securities Ltd.; and<br>
The transactions specified by Frederick Alan Lush in his letter of 23rd<br>
May, 1947, to the Prime Minister.<br>
If you are of opinion that there was any such misconduct or wrong-doing<br>
what person or persons were guilty of it and in what did it consist. </p>
<p>FIXATION OF WAGES AND SALARIES-REGULATIONS<br>
FURTHER AMENDED.<br>
On 13th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The Executive Council has approved a further re-organization of<br>
the wage-pegging provisions of National Security ( Economic Organization)<br>
Regulations. The amendment now made will permit action to . be<br>
taken under the 40-hour week legislation recently passed in New South<br>
Wales without danger of conflict with the wage-pegging provisions of<br>
the regulations. The amendment will, however, apply also to any similar measures<br>
that may be passed in other States. Its effect is to permit the payment<br>
of remuneration at an altered rate where the alteration is consequential<br>
on a reduction in working hours made under any State Act coming into<br>
force after to-day.""<br>

THE GOVERNMENT.<br>
POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH, JUNE, 1947.<br>
On 15th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-<br>
The Labour party is the greatest political party to-day that Australia<br>
has ever known and the only political party that proved, in the<br>
years of war, capable of governing this country. The Labour party at<br>
. uch conferences as this voices its views and discusses not only internal<br>
problems but also gives some thought to international problems associated<br>
with the life of this nation.<br>
I feel that the work of the Labour movement in New South Wales<br>
and in the federal sphere during the past six years is not a story I need<br>
reiterate. .1 do not say that there have not been some shortcomings.<br>
am one, privileged as I have been to lead the Federal Parliamentary<br>
Labour party, who realizes that in the life of a government there are<br>
some things that call for criticism. Criticism is not a bad thing, but I<br>
rhink criticism should be based on facts and should be directed, not<br>
towards individuals particularly, but. generally towards the methods<br>
used. "" Now, after six years in which the people have trusted the Labour<br>
party in the federal sphere and in a majority of States, we are faced<br>
with an equally grave responsibility, although not in the atmosphere of<br>
danger and war nor with the same difficulties. But we face a re-orientation<br>
of some of the views on some of the problems. We can fact our<br>
internal problems in an atmosphere of full employment and a better<br>
standard of living than in most countries to-day. We live in a very<br>
troubled world. Grent economic problems face other countries to-day.<br>
Europe is in a very bad way and many persons feel frustrated and disappointed<br>
that leading men of the world cannot find solutions to great<br>
At the inn! conferuce of trhe New S uth W le brh: inich tih A.\ Istrahm;<br>
.; iahour p; ir y. </p>
<p>problems which beset the world and set a road of guidance for the<br>
future. That is because countries hold such widely diverse views of<br>
what should be the methods and what guidance should ' be given.<br>
Australia can look at the problems very clearly. Great opportunities<br>
and the fulfilment or the achievement of the matters that those<br>
opportunities offer rests with the people in Australia-the Government<br>
can legislate and provide machinery.<br>
In the Pacific, Australia is an isolated island continent, but it<br>
c: an no longer stay out of the affairs of the world or for protection in<br>
defence depend on Britain. The economic problems which beset Britain<br>
to-day have left her in a position in which she must look to the<br>
Dominions to play a great part in maintaining stability and security.<br>
' This country, which is young and a country I hope which will grow<br>
to greater proportions offered opportunities and the Labour party is the<br>
only political party capable of governing the people and giving effect<br>
to their wishes.<br>
Those opportunities must not be lost. First, we must face the<br>
problem of bringing here hundreds of thousands of people from other<br>
countries. If British people are available so much the better, hut manpower<br>
in Britain is much needed to-day, so we must turn to Europe<br>
for hundreds to build up this country. We must determine the best<br>
methods to build Australia and fulfil our destiny. Because of isolation.<br>
we are far from the stress and strife in Europe. We ' have sonime reasonable<br>
stability. The efforts of the Government have been able not only<br>
to . meet the effects of war, but also the transition to peace. Some persons<br>
believe that because there is prosperity-because there are more<br>
jobs than people to fill them, because there are high prices from overseas<br>
exports-that that particular state of affairs, particularly in<br>
regard to prices, might last for ever. We must be prepared, in giving<br>
consideration to our economic affairs, for a reduction in those prices. It<br>
is possible that some measure of decline will come in the market before<br>
many years are passed. We must, in planning the economy of this<br>
country, realize that there is . likely to be some recession in the money<br>
coming to this country from our exports.<br>
In the world of interna. tional affairs, Australia has played a great<br>
part. It has participated in all the councils of the nations of the world.<br>
The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt), the Australian High<br>
Commissioner in the United Kingdom ( Mr. Beasley), the Australian<br>
Minister at Washington ( Mr. Makin) and the Australian High Commissioner<br>
to Canada ( Mr. Forde)-all representatives of the Labour<br>
movement-have played their part in seeing that Australia has been<br>
heard. We cannot any longer depend on Britain for the defence of this<br>
country. There may be a feeling of frustration that so little has been<br>
achieved so far towards a lasting peace, but there can be no mistake in<br>
the minds of people that there shall be an improved living standard<br>
and their objective is to achieve by some means or other some peace for<br>
the workers of the world. </p>
<p>"" Internally, we are living in a period of full employment. That<br>
has been one of the ideals of the Labour movement, but for the first time<br>
in my association with the Labour movement we have achieved that<br>
object. There must be no faltering in the Federal or . State Labour<br>
parties to ensure that that condition of affairs is maintained and, of<br>
course, to maintain the standard of living of the people. That does not<br>
rest with politicians and it does not rest with parliaments; it rests<br>
with the trade unions and the workers of this country. Unless they<br>
are prepared to play their part and give to the nation and to the<br>
community the very best that they can give, those objectives cannot be<br>
achieved. "" I say that the trade union movement owes not only a duty to their<br>
own organizations, but a duty to the community in which they live and<br>
the nation to which they belong. I hope that leaders in the trade union<br>
movement will be inspired in their efforts to see that some of the<br>
industrial troubles which arise will be reduced. I understand that<br>
strikes prove a corrective for many injustices. I can understand an<br>
industrial stoppage on principle, but there have been a. number of<br>
stoppages during recent years not connected with such matters. There<br>
have been stoppages in connexion with demarcation disputes-not disputes<br>
with Governments but dispute among the workers. It"" is shocking<br>
that trade unions in a matter of demarcation are not prepared<br>
to take it to a judicial authority. They are like a comic opera and<br>
persons working together who create these situations are not working<br>
for the common good.<br>
"" I make it very clear that you should take from these conferences<br>
through the country the realization that this is not a movement<br>
organized for the glorification of its leaders or trade union leaders, but<br>
for the benefit of the people and workers of the country. Personal animosities<br>
cannot be avoided, but whatever they are they have to be subjugated<br>
to the great masses of the people. I ask you to infuse the fire<br>
and spirit which characterized the pioneers of the Labour movement<br>
into the hundreds and thousands throughout the country and see that<br>
Labour is returned to power.<br>
There are persoins who try to cling to the coat-tails of the Labour<br>
movement to espouse philosophies which are not philosophies of the<br>
Labour movement. I say that this is a country of freedom of expression<br>
and freedom to establish any political philosophy, but let those persons<br>
preach their philosophy from their own platform. The Labour movement<br>
lives and achieves the ideals and aspirations of the great working<br>
class persons of this country. The working class consists of men<br>
and women who work, whether manually or otherwise, for the country<br>
and give of their best in their daily toil, whatever that may be.<br>
The Labour party is unique among political parties because in<br>
six States it has its organizations. Men come from 4,000 miles apart<br>
who bring to that Federal Parliamentary Labour party many diverse<br>
views. It is no easy matter to cater for the many parts of Australia<br>
in federal policy, and that is done by federal conference and translated </p>
<p>into action by the Federal Labour party. It is a great achievement for<br>
a party to create such solidarity as that. There is only one way to<br>
achieve such things, whatever personal feelings we have, and that is by<br>
solidarity. The history of this and every country shows that the people<br>
will not trust parties who are not able to govern themselves and trust<br>
only parties who have ways and methods of achieving their objective.<br>
T think it does no harm to the Labour party or trade union movement<br>
( which forms the foundation of the Labour party) when criticism is<br>
levelled from time to time provided the criticism is based on facts. We<br>
do not wish to live in a mutual admiration society. I have in my party<br>
over 70 federal members drawn from all parts of Australia. It is not<br>
to be expected that they will agree on every proposal or be able to<br>
: gree with one another always. They always agree on objectives, but<br>
sometimes nor on the methods to achieve those objectives. That doe.<br>
not harm the Labour movement. No party can live unless it is progressive<br>
and pressing forward. It must go onwards or die. The con-<br>
: servative parties of this country, because of the diverse interests and<br>
animositie. which exist between persons opposed to Labour methods,<br>
are not able to survive. The solidarity of this movement, particularly<br>
in the war period, was the solidarity necessary for the welfare and preservation<br>
of this country.<br>
In regard to international affairs, our relations with other countries,<br>
our defence policy and the building up of industries are some<br>
, f the great problems only Labour governments are capable of solving.<br>
Relations with other nations of the world must go through the Federal<br>
Government. The Federal Labour party should know the feelings and<br>
v. iews of the people we represent. Out of these conferences you will<br>
give an indication to the Federal Labour party of your outlook on the<br>
questions of the future. I do not think that some persons in Australia<br>
fully realize the changed order in the world to-day. We have a proud<br>
history, but we must not live in the past. The methods of 20 years<br>
ngo are no good to-day. We live in a troubled world. We must be<br>
prepared to keep to the fundamentals of the Labour party, but always<br>
be prepared to modify the general outlook of our views on the affairs<br>
of the world and, in turn, on our own affairs as the affairs of the world<br>
affect us. We have to prepare to build a stronger nation in the Pacific<br>
than to-day, and try to look into the future. Many think just of to-day<br>
or just a year or two ahead. They feel that some particular features<br>
affect them personally and that they are the only ones that matter.<br>
I ask those persons to give some thought to overseas affairs and the<br>
future of this country. We must keep ourselves in close contact with<br>
the affairs of the world and in close contact with other nations. I<br>
believe that only by close co-operation with the people of Great<br>
Britain and the people of America-indeed, with the English-speaking<br>
peoples of the world-can -we keep world peace in the future.<br>
"" It may be that the Australian Government has had differences<br>
with Great Britain on administrative matters. Whatever those differences<br>
and however justifiable, one fact is completely clear-we in the </p>
<p>Pacific must maintain a close co-operation not only with America but<br>
with Great Britain. Regarding Great Britain, apart from sentimental<br>
reasons, a great material factor applies. Great Britain has been the<br>
greatest market for Australian primary product exports, and if only for<br>
material reasons close co-oppration with Great Britain for trade is<br>
essential. "" It is a great thing in the Labour movement to feel that we take<br>
in thousands of unions and branches. Men and women are working<br>
for no reward to themselves ' but to give effect to the wishes of the Labour<br>
movement. It is a great thing and a great comfort for any one leading<br>
a party or associated in some task of leadership of a party to know<br>
that these men and women support them. I know that in Australia<br>
hundred. of thousands have been in the Labour movement for 30 or<br>
years without seeking any reward for themselves but for the Labour<br>
movement to be placed in power. The future of this country and the<br>
future of the Labour movement rest with the people themselves. Every<br>
oC e must bhe prepared, whatever be his calling, whatever his duty, in<br>
this timc. of opportunities, to give of his very best. There is only one<br>
way of achieving success and that way is hard work. I ask nothing<br>
more of the movement but to stick solidly together. It has been trusted<br>
lby the peophl to perform the great tasks connected with the problems<br>
of the war and to carry on the tasks associated with the transition into<br>
peace and plan for the years ahead. That is the great trust the people<br>
have placed in us. and I ask the Labour movement to give to those<br>
chosen to lead all the help that cun be given for the needs of the community<br>
and the needs of the nation. By that means can the Labour<br>
movement remain great. If that is done, I have no fear that the<br>
Labour movement will go on growing stronger, and greater, in the<br>
interests of Australia.""<br>

"" The first three operations were highly successful, the amount<br>

<p>"" The last operation has not sold as promptly as the previous issues,<br>
due to a variety of reasons, the factors chiefly responsible being the<br>
disturbed international situation. Whereas honds were underwritten<br>
for the full amount, the underwriters were left with 2,000,000 dollars<br>
of the short term and 6,500,000 dollars of the long term when the loan<br>
closed on 8-th July, 1947. Sales of these securities in large parcels<br>
resulted in a heavy fall on the market. At the close of business on 11th<br>
July, 1947. only -2,( iOO, 000 dollars of the long term issue was<br>
unplaced, the whole of the short term having been sold. The short<br>

WHEAT STABILIZATION SCHEME.<br>
POST-WAR--FEDERATION PROPOSAL.<br>
On 19th June, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard),<br>
said that representatives of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation<br>
from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia had placed<br>
proposals before him for amendments to the Government's five years<br>
wheat stabilization plan. The federation asked that the guaranteed<br>
floor price for wheat be based on the cost of the production, which would<br>
include a remunerative wage for the grower and interest on capital<br>
involved. It asked that the price of wheat for local consumption<br>
as flour should be based on a cost plus principle, subject to immediate<br>
and periodic review and adjustment in accordance with fluctuations in<br>
cost. TJhe federation's request that the plan should not begin until the<br>
marketing of the crop subsequent to its proposed amended plan coming<br>
into effect would mean that the present plan as it affected 1945-46<br>
and 1946-47 crops would be abandoned. It might also require the<br>
abandonment of the stabilization plan in respect of the 1947-48 harvest,<br>
because it was likely that time would not permit the Commonwealth<br>
and the States to pass legislation through the respective Parliaments in<br>
time to make it apply to that harvest.<br>
He had told the deputation that if the Government was to go on<br>
with stabilization it could be expected that when prices for wheat were<br>
high growers should provide some reserves for periods when prices were<br>
low. If they did so. the Government was prepared to back the plan's<br>
operation. It could not exclude from the operation of the plan the<br>
harvest marketed when prices, as at present, were abnormally high.<br>
The Government would be prepared, however, to consider an extension<br>
of the plan be-' yond the 1949-50 harvest. The present Act would enable<br>
that to, be donne provided State Governments were agreeable. He would </p>
<p>consider recommending to the Government that the present plan. be<br>
extended for two years with provision that a review be made during<br>
the period to determine whether it should be extended for a further<br>
three years, making ten years in all.<br>
POST-WAR PRODUCTION COSTS, INQUIRY.<br>
On 4th July, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-<br>
"" The chairman of the Wheat Costs of Production Committee<br>
informs me that over 3,000 questionaires were issued at random to<br>
wheat farmers and that only 250 have been completed and returned.<br>
I have informed the committee that I would not ask it to make a<br>
report if it were of the opinion that the facts before it were not sufficient<br>
to give a true picture of the industry. I ask wheat-growers to fill. in<br>
the questionnaires and return them without delay.""<br>

ACREAGE-1947-48.<br>
On 29th July, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that Australian wheat sowings,<br>
which had declined heavily during the war, had now appreciated, and<br>

Recently it has been represented that eligible serving members<br>
of the forces who may be permitted to wear civilian clothes were at<br>
a disadvantage by comparison with discharged members because they<br>
were not in possession of the appropriate emblem denoting their having<br>
participated in active service. It has been decided that the authority<br>
under which eligible personnel who are still serving in the Royal<br>
Australian Navy may be issued with the ' Returned from Active<br>

PEACE.<br>
JAPAN-WHALING EXPEDITION.<br>
On 2sird June, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt<br>
said-On 7th August, 1946, the Japanese Government was authorized<br>
by S. C. A. P. to undertake a whaling expedition to the Antarctic during<br>
the 1946-47 season. Principal reasons given for the authorization were<br>
. hortage of food in Japan and world shortage of oils and fats. There<br>
was no prior consultation with interested Allied Governments, such as<br>
\ nstralia, Britain, New Zealand and Norway.<br>
The Australian Government immediately made strong representations<br>
to the United States on grounds of past prejudicial action by<br>
Japanese ships to Australian security, on earlier violations by the<br>
Japanese cf international whaling regulations, and on the inefficiency<br>
and wastefulness of Japanese methods. It was a matter for special<br>
concern to Australia that decisions of this kind should be made while<br>
the occupation of Japan was still proceeding and in advance of the<br>
peace settlement, and without reference to the overall question of<br>
reparations. The Australian prntest was supported by Norway, Britain<br>
aind New Zealand.<br>
After the Australian representations, it was agreed that an Australian<br>
observer should accompany the expedition; furthermore, that<br>
an international flag should be substituted for Japanese insignia; that<br>
the routes to be taken by the expedition to and from the Antarctic<br>
should be notified to interested governments and that the oil obtained<br>
as a result of the expedition should be subject to allocation by the International<br>
Emergency Food Council. Authorization of the expedition<br>
became operative only for the 1946-47 season, the United States undertalking<br>
that other interested governments would be fully consulted should </p>
<p>: ny further Japanese activities outside Japanese wa. ters be contemplated.<br>
The United States agreed that the future of the Japanese whaling<br>
industry and the disposal of Japanese whaling equipment was a<br>
matter for decision by the Allies.<br>
"" The Australian Government is opposed to the re-establishment<br>
of the Japanese whaling industry in Antarctic waters. Such re-establishment,<br>
which in effect means the creation again of naval potential, is<br>
ipposed to a just settlement with Japan and should be strenuously<br>
resisted by every Allied country which contributed to victory in the<br>
Pacific war. When it became apparent recently that, notwithstanding<br>
the undertaking regarding consultation and the adverse report by the<br>
Australian observer with . the first expedition, it was proposed to send a<br>
second Japanese expedition to the Antarctic, the Australian Government<br>
made the positive and practical suggestion to the United States<br>
that a unit of the Japanese whaling fleet be operated by Australia, with<br>
the aid of Britain, New Zealand and Norway. Food, fats and oils<br>
from the expedition would be at the disposal of S. C. A. P. for distribution.<br>
The Australian offer was communicated to the United States<br>
State Department, and while under consideration the announcement of<br>
a second expedition was made.<br>
The decision of 22nd June, 1947, to approve of a second Japanese<br>
whaling expedition for 1947-48, thereby by-passing . the Far Eastern<br>
Commission, which alone is supposed to determine questions of policy<br>
and which actually has this matter on its business sheet for 26th June,<br>
is opposed to the best long-term Allied interests. The Australian<br>
Government intends to press this question in the Far Eastern Commission<br>
to secure a review of the present proposal.<br>
"" The ultimate disposition of Japanese whaling facilities and equipmnent,<br>
as well as the question of the future of the Japanese whaling<br>
industry, must be a matter for Allied consultation and decision. The<br>
appropriate place for any decision that may be taken is the peace<br>
table."" JAPAN-BRITISH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.<br>
On 23rd June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The . preliminary conference of British Commonwealth countries<br>
to discuss the peace treaty with Japan will meet in Canberra on 26th<br>
August, 1947."" JAPAN-ADVISORY COMMITTEE.<br>
On 8th July, 1947, Dr. Evatt said that he was establishing an<br>
ndvisory committee to examine questions related to the Japanese peace<br>
settlement. The committee would meet under the chairmanship of Sir<br>
Frederic Eggleston, formerly Australian Minister to China and later </p>
<p>to the United States. Sir Frederic had been working on problems<br>
related to the Japanese settlement in conjunction with departmental<br>
officers both at Canberra and abroad. The committee would include<br>
members of Parliament in addition to a representative group of Australians<br>
versed in one aspect or another of the subject.<br>
JAPAN-PROPOSED UNITED STATES MEETING.<br>
On 17th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Australia is always prepared to take part in any discussions that<br>
will expedite the Pacific peace settlement and ' appreciates the present<br>
proposal of the United States Government to hold a conference of eleven<br>
nations on 19th August, 1947. But the date is entirely unsuitable to<br>
Australia in view of the British Commonwealth conference on 26th<br>
August, 1947.""<br>
On 18th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Australia will attend the coliference convened by the United<br>
States Government on the Japanese peace settlement, but on the date<br>
will depend which Minister will attend, and whether the Minister for<br>
External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) can fit in his engagements with the<br>
conference."" NATIONAL THEATRE.<br>
On 23rd June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chiflcy) saidpropose<br>
to appoint a committee soon after Parliament reassembles<br>
in September, 1947, to examine the possibility of establishing<br>
a national theatre at Canberra. Some persons believe that the theatre<br>
is for educational purposes but I think it should also have an entertainment<br>
value as well. I believe that it would be possible to have a small<br>
theatre to which leading players in companies from the States could be<br>
hrought to give performances.""<br>

CAR CHASSIS IMPORTS.<br>
On 24th June, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)<br>
; nlnounced that imports of pressed metal body panels, not fabricated<br>
beyond trimming of the edges, would be permitted for use in the manufacture<br>
in Australia of bodies for car and truck chassis, provided the<br>
pane! s were shlipped from the country of origin to Australia on or<br>
before 31st December, 1947. The imports were permitted because of the<br>
present shortage of steel sheets suitable for motor vehicle body manufacture<br>
and to assist in making the maximum number of motor vehicles<br>
available to Australian essential users in the shortest possible time. </p>
<p>JAPAN.<br>
TRADE-PRIVATE TRADING.<br>
On 26th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The control authorities in Japan have fixed 15th August, 1947, as<br>
the date on which the resumption of private international commercial<br>
relations with Japan will be authorized. Because of accommodation<br>
difficulties, only 400 private trade representatives will be allowed entry<br>
into Japan in the initial stages and the length of their stay will be<br>
limited to 21 days unless arrangements are made by the Governments<br>
concerned with the control authorities for an extension of this period.<br>
:\ ustralia has been provisionially allotted a quota of 24 representatives.<br>
"" An inter-departmental committee is engaged in considering the<br>
priority to be accorded to private traders who desire to visit Japan and<br>
interested persons are invited to submit applications before 5th July,<br>
1947. Traders who desire to arrange for the purchase of Japanese<br>
goods should submit full particulars to the Department of Trade and<br>
C: ustoms, while those interested in selling goods to Japan should furnish<br>
, letails to the Department of Commerce and Agriculture.<br>
"" In the early stages private trade will not reach substantial proportions.<br>
Because of prior commitments, the control authorities have<br>
indicated that cotton textiles, raw silk and tea will not be available<br>
immediately for s-ale to private traders. The Commonwealth Government<br>
has arranged for the purchase of 12,000,000 yards of cotton textiles<br>
and quantities of raw silk and will continue these purchases until<br>
private traders are permitted to operate. Purchases on private account<br>
will be governed -by the range and quantity of goods available and the<br>
limitations imposed by the Australian import licensing system.<br>
Australian exports to Japan are likely to be restricted to wool and<br>
a; few minor commodities not subject to international control nor<br>
covered by long-term contracts with other countries.""<br>
On 16th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
"" A number of applications have been received from businessmen<br>
who desire to send representatives to Japan. A selection has been made<br>
by an inter-departmental committee to determine the limited number<br>
who will comprise the first party to visit Japan. The interests concerned<br>
will be notified of the selections at -an early date.<br>
Priority has been accorded to firms which ' had extensive pre-war<br>
interests in Japanese trade and representatives of associations and<br>
manufacturers who are anxious to obtain supplies of essential commodities<br>
for use in Australian industry.<br>
"" An overall consideration has been the class of goods in which it<br>
is desired to trade. In this connexion, when private trade with Japan<br>
is resumed, raw silk and cotton textiles will not be available for purchase<br>
by private traders immediately. Merchant-to-merchant trading will be<br>
permitted in other goods, but imports to Australia will be subject to<br>
licensing control on the basis at present accorded to imports from hard </p>
<p>currency areas. Import licences will be granted only for essential goods<br>
which are not available in adequate quantities from local or sterling<br>
sources of supply. Licences will not be granted for importation of fancy<br>
goods, toys, crockery and other less essential goods that featured in prewar<br>
trade with Japan.<br>
As each party will be allowed to stay in Japan for only a limited<br>
ipriod, further opportunities will occur for visits by Australian business<br>
representatives. Commercial interests not included in the first party<br>
will receive consideration in subsequent parties.""<br>
TRADE-WOOL.<br>
On l2nd July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Following negotiations . between the Comnimonwealth Government<br>
and the Supreme Command Allied Powers in Japan, 7,481 bales of particular<br>
types of low grade wool were shipped to Japan in May, 1947.<br>
Arrangements were made for payment in dollars in New York as a<br>
set-off against the purchase price of raw silk obtained in Japan by the<br>
Commonwealth Government.<br>
Following representations by Cabinet decided . to-day that<br>
further negotiations be instituted for the sale of somewhat better types<br>
of wool. The Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) has been authorized<br>
to take up the negotiations and, if successful, . the Australian Wool<br>

"" I have to-day received the following message from the Director-<br>
General of U. N. R. R. A. at Washington ( Major-General Lowell W.<br>

I should like to take this opportunity of extending to the Commonwealth<br>
Government and to the people of Australia the great appreciation<br>
for the generous and effective contribution they have made to the<br>
work of this organization. Those contributions, with similar assistance<br>
from other uninvaded members of the United Nations, have provided<br>
the means of saving the lives of endless millions of people in the war<br>
devastated countries. From its experience, U. N. R. R. A. knows how<br>
much that assistance h'as been appreciated, and there exists to-day in </p>
<p>the hearts of millions of people throughout the world a very real<br>
gratitude to the people of Australia for the supplies and services they<br>
have received through the organization of U. N. R. R. A.<br>
I should like to thank you also for the provision of so many fine and<br>
experienced meu and women to serve with U. N. R. R. A. in many parts<br>

<p>POST-WAR-INTERNAL ROUTES, AIRWAYS CHARGES.<br>
On 4th July, 1947, the Minister for Civil Aviation ( Mr. Drakeford)<br>
announced that the Government had decided to introduce charges for the<br>
use by operators of aircraft of airways facilities provided by the<br>
Commonwealth. Modern air transport demanded increasing ground<br>
facilities, aeradio, and navigational aids and meteorological services,<br>
and it had become customary throughout the world for the authority<br>
providing the airways facilities to make charges for their use, designed<br>
to recoup part of the expenditure. It had been"" decided that a system<br>
of air route charges should be applied on regular services regardless of<br>
the number of landings involved. Aircraft used for purposes other<br>
than regular airline services would be classified according to the nature<br>
of the use to which they were put, and annual fees would be charged.<br>
Payment of charges would be introduced as from 1st August, 1947.<br>
On 25th July, 1947, Mr. Drakeford announced details of the system<br>
of charges for the use of Commonwealth aerodromes and air route facilities<br>
to he payable as from 1st August, 1947. It was estimated that the<br>
charges would bring in about œ 300,000 a year, but that would recoup<br>
the Commonwealth for only a small portion of its annual expenditure<br>
on maintenance of air ports and airways facilities. Aircraft would be<br>
divided into four classes-<br>
Those used for purely private purposes: tlhoie used fir tle hllim. ris purpo. ses<br>
of the owner: those used for reiumnerative purposes other th: rin n r I,; gilari rline<br>
and those used for the operation of airline services.<br>
The first three classes would pay an annual fee which would be<br>
lowest in the private category and progressively higher in the other two<br>
classes. The fee would be based on the weight of the aircraft and would<br>
cover the use of any aerodromes and airways facilities. Examples of the<br>
annual charges payable by owners of aircraft in eacl of the three classes<br>
were:-SClass 1. Clw 2. Class 3.<br>
t d.<br>
Tiger Moth 3 5 1 0 9 15 0<br>
D. H. 4 ( l) raon) 8 2 ti 17 5 0 25 7 6<br>
Anson 14 12 6 29 5 0 43 17 6<br>
Operators of aircraft used on regular aircraft services would not pay<br>
the annual charges for those aircraft but would pay a charge in respect<br>
of each route unit traversed. To determine the number of units the<br>
routes had been classified having regard to their length, the number of<br>
aerodromes and emergency landing ground and the availability of<br>
navigational aids. The comparatively short Melbourne-Sydney stage<br>
was rated as a two-unit route, while a much longer but less highly<br>
developed route such as the Derby-Kimberley Stations route was classified<br>
as one unit. A basic charge had been fixed for each type of aircraft </p>
<p>a~ nd the amnount payable for c ach flight would be the basic charge<br>
multiplied by the number of units, traversed. Examples of the charges<br>
were: M15esi1. 3 W. u y. Adelaide or Hohart-D. C. 3. œ 4 14S. lid.-D. U. 4.<br>

The charges did not apply to aircraft used on regular international<br>
nir services. Charges for-those services would be promnulgated later.<br>

On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" In 1945, the Northern Australia Development Committee -was<br>
appointed comprising representatives of the Commonwealth, Queensland<br>
and Western Australian Governments. Matters of policy are canczidered<br>

<p>"" The committee h-as prepared a comprehensive report dealing<br>
specifically with general measures for the relief of disabilities; specific<br>
measures for the development of industries; and measures necessary to<br>
develop specific regions.<br>
Cabinet decided to-day that a sub-committee, comprising the Minister<br>
for the Interior, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and<br>
myself as Treasurer and Acting Minister for Defence, should examine<br>
the report -and recommendations of the committee, and report to<br>

NEW GUINEA-PAPUA-WAR GRATUITY FOR NATIVES.<br>
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The question of payment of war gratuity for natives of New<br>
Guinea and Papua was considered by the Parliamentary Committee<br>
which furnished a report on the question of war gratuity. The outstanding<br>
service rendered by these natives was fully recognized, but the<br>
Iommittee was not in possession of sufficient information to enable a<br>
recommendation to be made as to the appropriate method of rewarding<br>
their service. The question has been since considered after consultation<br>
with the Departments of External Territories, the Navy and the Army.<br>
"" C: abinet to-day approved of a gratuity for natives of New Guinea<br>
and Papua who were enlisted as members of the forces, payment to be<br>
at the rate of 5s. a month for each month of service; the gratuity not<br>
to be paid for any period prior to 7th Pecember, 1941; no qualifying<br>
period to be required; native members who have been discharged for<br>
disciplinary reasons to be ineligible for the gratuity; payment to be<br>
made as early as practicable.<br>
An ex gratia payment has been approved, subject to the conditions<br>
approved for natives enlisted in the forces, for the following classes<br>
of civilian natives-members of the New Guinea Police Force and the<br>
Royal Papuan Constabulary; civilians employed as combatant soldiers<br>

<p>RATIONING.<br>
SUGAR-REVOCATION.<br>
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifey) said-<br>
"" Cabinet decided to-day that rationing of sugar be abandoned forthwith.<br>
The principal reasons for introducing sugar rationing no longer<br>
; apply. Sugar rationing in Australia does not greatly help Britain. There<br>
is an arrangement whereby the United States, Canada and Britain draw<br>
equal per capita shares from the world's sugar supply. For every<br>
10,000 tons of sugar contributed by Australia to the pool, Britain<br>
draws only about 2,000 tons. Distribution of sugar is decided by the<br>
World Emergency Food Council. World production of sugar showed a<br>
marked increase in the 1946-47 season.""<br>
MEAT-CONTINUANCE.<br>
On 2nd July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br>
Cabinet was informed to-day that representatives of the Meat and<br>
Allied Trades Federation had asked the Minister for Comunerce ( Mr.<br>
Pallard) and the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice) that rationing<br>
and price control of meat should be removed from 15th August,<br>
1947, that being the period of flush supply.<br>
The meat position in Britain is acute and on : 3th .1 ine, 1947, the<br>
Chancellor of the Exchequer ( Dr. Dalton) announced in the House of<br>
Commons that there would be a further cut in the imeat ration from<br>
is. 4d. worth a week ( including 4d. worth of canned meat) to is. 2d.<br>
worth a week.<br>
Cabinet decided that it was not possible to remove the controls.<br>
It would be very wrong for the Commonwealth Government to permit<br>
unrestricted consumption of meat when the British people are having<br>
their meagre ration further reduced. The matter will be brought before<br>
Cabinet again when there are indications that -upply of meat in Australia<br>
will be sufficient to provide not only an unrestricted Au. l tralian<br>
demand but an adequate amount for export to Brit: liii.""<br>
SHIPBUILDING.<br>

On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
Cabinet decided to-day that interstate and intra-state -vessels ( but<br>
not including passenger and other vessels required by and under charter<br>
to the Navy Department) be de-requisitioned at the earliest possible<br>
date and that the Minister for Shipping ( Senator Ashley) de-requisition<br>
individual vessels as they terminate voyages and come into position<br>
for re-delivery at home ports. But the Minister is empowered to defer<br>
the de-requisitioning of particular vessels when such action is regarded<br>
by him as essential to ensure efficient conduct of particular . rvice for<br>
example the services to New Guinea and adjacent islands. </p>
<p>Details associated with the matter will be dealt with by a Cabinet<br>
sub-committee comprising Senator Ashley, the Minister for Customs<br>
( Senator Courtice) and myself.""<br>

AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.<br>
ROYAL MILITARY COLLEGE.<br>
On 2nd July, 1947, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Chambers)<br>
announced that the intake of cadets into the Royal Military College,<br>
Duntroon. w'ould be increased in 1948 to 60 Australians and ten New<br>
Zealanders. AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION.<br>
APPOINTMENTS.<br>
On 3rd July, 1947, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron)<br>
announced that Mr. J. S. Hanlon and Professor J. D. G. Medley had<br>
been appointed members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission<br>
for three years from 1st July, 1947.<br>
TARIFF.<br>
EXPORTS-STANDARDS.<br>
On ith July, 1947, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) said<br>
that Australian manufacturers must pay greater attention to the sales<br>
of their prodncts overseas if present industrial employment and production<br>
levels were to be maintained. There were no grounds for complacency<br>
in the fact that, despite export restrictions to ensure supplies<br>
for local needs, value of manufactures exported would probably reach<br>
œ 45,000,000. The figures had been achieved at a time when many competitive<br>
European countries had not reached their full export capacity<br>
of manufactures. Once local demand fell to normal, Australian surplus<br>
production would have to be exported, or productive capacity reduced<br>
with consequent unemployment. Manufacturers should remember that<br>
not only Australian production would reduce local demands.<br>
A good deal of Australian secondary industry had been built up<br>
behind protective harriers but a considerable section of it had never<br>
met the full shock of competition from imported goods, nor participated<br>
in the exucting business of overseas trading. Overseas countries had<br>
accepted Australian export methods to date, but would continue to do so<br>
only if the export business procedures practised by many Australian<br>
manufacturers and exporters were radically changed. To gain and<br>
hold thl export markets they would soon require manufacturers and<br>
exporters should conform to trading practices followed by competitor<br>
nations. Goods should be strongly packed, correctly labelled and documented<br>
and of competitive quality. </p>

NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES.<br>
POLICY-MEDIATION.<br>
On 9th July, 1947, the Minister for External Affair. i ( Dr. Evat)<br>
said that the Australian Government welcomed reports that further progress<br>
had been made towards a permanent settlement in Indonesia.<br>
The de facto authority of the republic, on the basis of the Linggadjati<br>
Agreement, which had been recognized by several goveriineiint, including<br>
the British and United States Governments, and which the Australian<br>
Government recognized, implied the acceptance by the Republican<br>
Government of very great responsibility; and the Republican<br>
Government, -as one of the negotiating parties and as a future essential<br>
element in the interim Federal State, had accepted the responsibility.<br>
The Australian Government sent representatives to Indonesia to assist<br>
in solving problems related to the recommencement of trade. The Australian<br>
Government wished both parties to understand that, if, in the<br>
interests of agreement between Dutch and Republican authorities on<br>
economic and political matters, the good offices of the Australian<br>
Government would be helpful, Australia would continue to do anything<br>
in its power to afford both the Netherlands and Indonesian authorities<br>
its assistance. Further, the Australian Government would give to the<br>
interim Federal Government, when established, advice and assistance in<br>
such matters as trade, finance, communications, and rconorni<br>
rehabilitation and development.<br>
POL[ CY-SECRITRTY COUNCIL.<br>
On 30th , July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" The Australian Government has ilnstricted its representative on<br>
the Security Council to draw the attention of the Security Council to<br>
the situation in Indonesia under Article 39 of the United Nation.<br>
Charter. Australia has taken action ten days after hostilities commenced<br>
in rndonisia, because, in accordance with Article 33 of the<br>
Charter. the parties to any dispute are obliged to seek a solution by<br>
negotiation or mediatics. Strenuous attempts have been made in consultation<br>
wilh other Governments, particularly Britain, United States<br>
and India, to bring ' about a solution in that way. However, it is felt<br>
that further delay is not justified because of the loss of life being<br>
sustained. "" The policy Australia has adopted in past disputes has been to<br>
urge an investigation under Article 34 of the Charter before any decisions<br>
are reached. However, the situation in Indonesia differs from<br>
any previously brought before the council. Hostilities are being<br>
carried on. Investigation is not required to establish the crucial fact.<br>
and, before the Council determines further action, it is essential that<br>
hostilities cease. For this reason, Australia has drawn the attention<br>
of the Council to the situation under Article 39 of the Charter and<br>
thereby gives power to the council immediately to order the cessation<br>
of hostilities and subsequently to take such further steps as are necessary<br>
to restore peace. </p>
<p>33<br>
This is the first time that this article has been invoked and it is<br>
the hope of the Government, in taking this section, that not only will<br>
hostilities cease, but that the Council will prove its worth in dealing<br>
quickly and effectively with a situation of this kind.<br>
"" In making this move, Australia still maintains the judicial attitude<br>
which it has . always maintained in considering any situation before<br>
the council. No attempt will be made to pre-judge the issue, and discussion<br>
of merits of the case will be avoided. The Australian representative<br>
will ask first that the necessary steps be taken to terminate<br>
hostilities, and, second, without discussing the merits of the situation,<br>
that both parties act upon Article 17 of the Linggadjati Agreement,<br>
which specifically provides that, in the event of disagreement between<br>
the two parties arising out of the agreement, a third party will be<br>
asked to arbitrate, or, failing that, the matter should be referred to<br>
the Chief Justice of the International Court. If the Australian proposal<br>
is given effect to without delay or debate on procedural issues,<br>
and if it is readily admitted by the Council that the situation is one<br>
within its jurisdiction, there should be good prospect of an immediate<br>
cessation of hostilities, and an immediate negotiation between the two<br>
parties with the assistance of a third party of their own choosing.<br>
Members of the Council should not therefore have to arbitrate or to<br>
pass judgment on the merits of the case.<br>
Action along these lines can be taken by the Council only if the<br>
Republican Government, not being a member of the United Nations,<br>
undertakes to observe the obligations and duties of the United Nations<br>
Charter, and in particular undertakes to observe Article 25, which<br>
obliges members to carry out the decisions of the council.""<br>

<p>Co mmon wealth Departments and statutory authorities employed only<br>
156,500, the balance of 400,000 being employed by State and local<br>
g~ overnment authorities.<br>
"" The latest bulletin issued by the Commonwealth -Statistician shows<br>

employed by Commonwealth authorities, 62 per cent, by State Governments<br>
and 10 per cent. -by local authorities. Nearly one-third of all<br>

A statement I made in October, 1946, set out that premiums on new<br>
share issues would not necessarily -be insisted upon. In that statement<br>
I requested that, where an issue at par was proposed by a company<br>
whose shares were appreciably above par, the application should include<br>
a statement of the reasons for not requiring a premium. Since then<br>
some companies -had required premiums-others had not.<br>
i"" I have reviewed the position and have decided that it is desirable<br>
ithe interests of the Australian economy that a premium should be<br>
required in all cases where there is an -appreciable margin between par<br>
value and market price. I have accordingly requested the Capital<br>
Issues Advisory Committee to give this aspect consideration in future.<br>
The committee will not insist on prohibitive premiums but will allow<br>
reasonable margins.""<br>

THE PRIME MINISTER<br>
( THE RIGHT HON. J. B. CHIFLEY). </p>
<p>MIGRATION.<br>
PASSPORTS--RESTRICTIONS, RELAXATIONS.<br>
On 18th June, 1946, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell) announced<br>
that restrictions imposed under National Security Act Regulations on the<br>
issue of passports would be lifted from 1st July, 1946. Passports for Japanl<br>
would be excepted. Any person would then be able to secure a passport<br>
to leave Australia by complying with the usual conditions. Restrictions<br>
on the issue of passports to doctors and nurses would be lifted. Previously,<br>
passports had been issued only to doctors and nurses wishing to do postgraduate<br>
courses or gain experience in overseas hospitals. Persons going<br>
to Britain must undertake to remain away for twelve months or until shipping<br>
facilities became available for their return without inconveniencing<br>
persons in the priority classes.<br>
BRITISH MIGRANTS-CHILDREN.<br>
On 2nd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
Legal guardianship of British children who were evacuated to Australia<br>
during 1940 for the duration of the war was vested in the Minister for the<br>
Interior ( later changed to the Minister for Immigration), and through him<br>
in the various State Child Welfare Departments under National Security<br>
( Oversea Children) Regulations. Of the 577 children who came to Australia,<br>
over 100 are remaining here, some temporarily to complete educational<br>
courses or apprenticeships and others permanently.<br>
Cabinet decided to-day that, with the expiry of the National Security<br>
Act on 31st December, 1946, legislation be introduced to enable the Minister<br>
for himnigration to continue as the legal guardian of overseas children who<br>
remain in Australia and also as the legal guardian of children brought to Australia<br>
under any governmental or non-governmental immigration organization.""<br>

<p>STRIKES-PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH.<br>
In Parliament.-On 4th July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley)<br>
said-Rightly or wrongly, and I am not entering into that at the moment,<br>
men in Queensland are on strike. I am not attempting to condone the<br>
strike I merely point out that if the men have decided that they will not<br>
work, they cannot be forced by law to go to work. What then is the next<br>
step They may be fined, and if they do not pay the fine they may be<br>
sent to jail. But the application of such a policy has never been successful<br>
in settling an industrial dispute. 1 defy anybody to prove to me that such<br>
action has ever produced industrial peace or effected a settlement of an<br>
industrial dispute. I have been associated with many industrial disputes.<br>
Even if a mistress has a difference with her house-maid, I am expected to<br>
intervene. The Leader of the Country Party ( Mr. Fadden) wants me, on<br>
behalf of the Government, to intervene in the Queensland meat dispute,<br>
Ilthough the State Industrial Court is in control of it and the State Govltenent,<br>
under its emergency powers, is operating the. relevant legislation<br>
to deal with it. What form of intervention does he propose Does he<br>
want me to order the men back to work<br>
I cannot visualize the Commonwealth Government intervening in this<br>
dispute, regrettable though it is. I do not attempt to condone it. The<br>
State Industrial Court, and the State Government with its emergency powers,<br>
has all the law that is needed. Will the enforcement of that law bring<br>
the dispute to an end We know that it will not. Intervention ly tile<br>
Commonrwealth Government would only make confusion worse confounded.<br>
All the parties to the dispute have been strong-minded, and have<br>
hotly supported the stand they have taken. There is too much strongmindedness<br>
in many industrial disputes. I do not deny that I would have<br>
tried to induce the parties to come together. I could not, of course,<br>
approach the Industrial Court. I do not know whether the State Government<br>
or the Premier would be able to make any approach to the court,<br>
because it has made the declaration, You must go back to work before<br>
we shall do ; nything'. The employers say, We will not meet you until<br>
you go back to work The reply of the employees is, We will not return<br>
to work except under pre-strike conditions'. Mr. Fadden has urged that<br>
the Commonwealth Government should intervene because of the influence<br>
that is being wielded by Communists. I have received hundreds of telegrams<br>
from those whom he has described as Communists, asking me to<br>
intervene in total disregard of the State Industrial Court and the State<br>
Government. To do that would be to destroy the effect of the Queensland<br>
law and the judgment of the Industrial Court; not that that would worry<br>
me very much, because I believe that there are some faults on that side.<br>
In my opinion, had the employers been prepared to give way a little, the<br>
strike could have been settled.<br>
Mr. Fadden wants me to override the State Industrial Court and the<br>
State Government, by the exercise of a power possessed by the Common.-<br>
wealth in other words, to flout the Queensland law and the State court.<br>
We have been unable to discern in what way any law that we could operate<br>
would be more effective than the laws which the Queensland Government </p>
<p>has the power to operate. Their application, of course, does not get the<br>
men back to work. There a great deal that I could say about the dispute<br>
but I do not waut to add fuel to the fire. I have been very disappointed<br>
at the trend of events. As a matter of fact, almost every day since I<br>
returned front abroad I have been told that negotiations were proceeding<br>
, and that the dispute would be settled. Yet it has dragged on from day to<br>
day. I do not want Mr. Fadden or this House to believe that I am happy<br>
about the position. If the Commonwealth were to engage in a fight not<br>
nily with the strikers, but also, if you like, with the'employers, the Queensland<br>
Government and the State Industrial Court, the state cf affairs would<br>
be akin to legislative anarchy. Had the Commonwealth Government issued<br>
an order stating that the meat-workers should return to work under prestrike<br>
conditions, the order would have been obeyed. But that would<br>
have been a complete flouting of the Queensland Industrial Court. It<br>
would have 1le e totally at variance withl the wishes of the State Government<br>
; aid would have been violently opposed by the employers. Merely because<br>
we did not wish to flout other laws that were operating in respect of the<br>
matter, such an order was not issued.<br>
The matter does not involve a return to work at award rates.<br>
Apparently, some agreements between the employers and employees have<br>
been operating for a period of years, giving to the employees considerable<br>
benefits which are not provided for in the award. At least, that claim is<br>
made by the employers and the court. The matter does not . touch the<br>
tour men who were dismissed from their employment in a bacon factory.<br>
I believe that their dispute could have been settled by the court separately.<br>
The Communists, near-Communists, or Cryptos-call them what you willare<br>
the very people who have been asking us to step in and override the<br>
State laws by saying to the employees, ' Go back to work on pre-strike<br>
conditions The dispute is most unfortunate. I do not make any apology,<br>
nor does the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Scullv), for having asked the<br>
Meat Controller to see whether personal contact would produce a better<br>
feeling and result in the men returning to work.<br>
We cannot drive men back to work. They are really in no different<br>
position from that of the milk producers who refused to supply milk. Men<br>
have the right to refuse to work. I admit that it is unjust to the community.<br>
In the final analysis, I suppose men have the right to dispose<br>
of their labour just as the man who produces wheat or any other commodity<br>
has the right to dispose of it.<br>
I believe that if suitable action had been taken to bring employers and<br>
employees together a settlement might have been reached long ago. However,<br>
I cannot see why the Commonwealth Government should attempt to<br>
override the State Industrial Court in opposition to the State Government,<br>
, or why we should attempt to override the State emergency legislation.""<br>
UNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.<br>
In Parliament.-On 4th July, 1946, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction<br>
( Mr. Dedman) said-<br>
The total number of persons unemployed in Australia on 21st June,<br>
1946, was 11,100, about 60 per cent. of whom were receiving unemployment </p>
<p>benefit. The other 40 per cent. were receiving a re-employment allowance<br>
as ex-servicemen while awaiting employment in the type of work thrlv<br>
desired."" PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br>
POULTRY FARMING-EGGS, CONTROL, CESSATION FIXED.<br>
On 19th June, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Scully) announced<br>
that the control of the egg industry under National Security Act Regulations<br>
would continue in operation until 31st December, 1946, when the Act expired.<br>
It was previously proposed that control should cease on 30th June, 1946,<br>
in view of the establishment of a central organization by the several State<br>
Egg Marketing Boards known as Egg Boards of Australia Limited which<br>
intended to take over control of the industry as from 1st July, 1946.<br>
Circumstances precluded the company from commencing operations and he<br>
had authorized continuance of Commonwealth control until 31st December.<br>
1946, before which date the position regarding the organization should he<br>
clarified. EXPORTS TO BRITAIN--EGGS.<br>
On 19th June, 1946, Mr. Scully announced that exports to the British<br>
Ministry of Food from Ist July to 31st December, 1946, would be 1,000,000<br>
cases of eggs, equivalent to 30,000,000 dozen eggs as well as about 20,000,0C. 1<br>
lb. of frozen egg pulp, equivalent to nearly 17,000,000 dozen eggs.<br>
COTTON-BOUNTY.<br>
On 2nd July, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) said that<br>
the Raw Cotton Bounty Act would expire on 31st December, 1946, and the<br>
Government had decided to introduce legislation to extend the operation<br>
of the Act sc that producers would be guaranteed that the present net<br>
return of 15d. per lb. of raw cotton above the grade known as strict good<br>
ordinary"" would be continued on cotton produced in Australia during<br>
1947 and each year until 31st December, 1951. The guaranteed net returns<br>
would be computed after taking into account the net return from by-products<br>
of raw cotton. Raw cotton of '. strict good ordinary"" or lower grades<br>
would continue to receive bounty at half the appropriate rate as provided<br>
under the Act. The bounty had been extended subject to'the Queensland<br>
Government making every endeavour to implement undertakings given<br>
during 1939-40 to improve the efficiency of cotton growing.<br>
PARLIAMENT.<br>
BROADCASTING-BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 19th June, 1946, the Postmaster-General ( Senator<br>
Cameron) introduced the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Bill.<br>
Senator Cameron said-<br>
The broadcasting of the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament<br>
has received the careful consideration of the Government, and it has decided<br>
that arrangements be made for these broadcasts to be introduced during </p>
<p>tihe present session. Investigations have demonstrated that it is not<br>
practicable to ( establish a separate network of medium-wave stations to<br>
broadcast the proceedings of Parliament. In any case, the establishment<br>
of such a network would involve an expenditure in the neighbourhood of<br>
' 500,000. The Goverunment considers that it would be preferable to commence<br>
the service on some modified plan which would not cause so much disturbanice<br>
to existing programme arrangements. The Government has reached<br>
the conclusion that the service should be commenced on an experimental<br>
basis, the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings being confined at the<br>
outset to the second national station in the capital city of each State and<br>
in Newca: ttle. If, as expected, the innovation proves acceptable to the<br>
public, it will 1) 0bnee cessary to determine from time to time the extent to<br>
which the facilities it is intended to use at first should be expanded. Accordingly,<br>
provision has been made in the bill for the employment of such of the<br>
other national stations as may be prescribed. Consideration would, of<br>
course, be given to the use of short-wave stations.<br>
The Government holds the. view that control of the broadcasts should<br>
lie exercised by Parliament itself through a joint parliamentary committee.<br>
The bill accordingly provides for the appointment of a committee including<br>
the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.<br>
It will be appreciated that there are a number of details to be settled in connexion<br>
with the apportionment of broadcasting time between both Houses<br>
of the Parliament when they are sitting simultaneously, and in regard to<br>
the rights of members, technical and programme arrangements. It is the<br>
Government's desire that the joint committee should examine all these<br>
questions and recommend to Parliament the general principles on which<br>
the broadcasts should be undertaken. After the adoption of its recommendations<br>
by both Houses, the joint committee will control the subsequent<br>
arrangements. From tinm'' to time questions may arise which will require<br>
prompt attention and it is desirable that the joint committee should have<br>
authority to delegate, to a sub-committee, its powers to determine the days<br>
on which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of either House<br>
shall be broadcast.<br>
"" The Government accepts the view that the immunities and privileges<br>
applying to debates within Parliament should be extended to the broadcasts<br>
parliamentary proceedings.<br>
The Bill embraces the foregoing conclusions and, in anticipation of<br>
it being acceptable to Parliament, arrangements have been made, with the<br>
concurrence of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House<br>
of Representatives, for the erection of a control booth in each House and for<br>
the installation of such equipment as is necessary to enable the broadcasts<br>
to be undertaken. It should be practicable to commence the broadcasting<br>
of parliamentary proceedings before the end of the present session, the actual<br>
' late being determined'by the joint committee, which will be selected as<br>
; oon as the measure becomes law."" </p>
<p>In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, Senator Cameron moved the<br>
following amendment:-<br>
One of the members of the committee shall be the President of the Senate, one<br>
member shall be the Speaker of the Hou.' e of Representatives, and, of the other four<br>
members of the committee, two shall be members of, and appointed by, the Senate<br>
and two shall be members of, and appointed by, the House of Representatives.<br>
[ The amendlment w~ is carried.]<br>
In Parliament.-On 4th July, 1946, the Minister for Information ( Mr.<br>
Calwell) moved an amendment to the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting<br>
Bill to provide that the Joint Committee on the broadcasting of<br>
parliamentary proceedings -hlould comprise nine members inst-:: r! of six.<br>
[ The amendment was carried and, later, was carried in the Senate.]<br>
[ The bill was passed.]<br>
In Parliament.-On 5th July, 1946, the Speaker ( Mr. Roscvear), chairman,<br>
the President ( Senator Brown), Senators Arnold and Gib-, o, Messrs.<br>
Corser, Fraser, Haylen, Holt and Sheehan were appointed members of thl<br>
Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings.<br>
In Parliament.-On 5th July, 1946, the Joint Committee submitted the<br>
following report:-<br>
Days on which proceedings shall be broadcast: The proceedings of Parliament.<br>
shall be broadcast on each day on which either House is sitting.<br>
Period during which proceedings shall be broadcast: The broadcast shall commence<br>
on each sitting day at the time fixed for the meeting of the House whose opening<br>
proceedings are to be broadcast on that day as determined by the Joint Committee.<br>
and shall cease when the adjournment is moved in the House which is being broadcast<br>
at that time.<br>
Allocation of broadcasting time between the Senate and tie House of Representatives:<br>
The allocation of broadcasting time between the Senate and the House of Representatives<br>
shall be in accordance with the views of the Joint Committee, or its sub-committee,<br>
on the importance of the impending debate and the public interest attaching thereto.<br>
The committee recognizes that in practice more time will be allotted to the House of<br>
Representatives than to the Senate.<br>
Re-broadcast of questions without notice and answers Within the limits of time<br>
available, questions without notice and answers in each House shall be re-broadcast<br>
between 7.20 p. m. and 7.55 p. m. on each sitting day.<br>
Broadcast and re-broadcast through national stations: No broadcast or re.<br>
broadcast of the proceedings of either House shall be made except through national<br>
broadcasting stations unless the Joint Committee otherwise determines.<br>
[ The report was adopted.]<br>
PRIVILEGE-PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS.<br>
In Parliament.--On 4th July, 1946, the Acting Attorney-General<br>
( Mr. Holloway) introduced the Parliamentary Papers Bill. Mr. Holloway<br>
said-This bill proposes to give absolute protection against civil or criminal<br>
proceedings, for example proceedings for libel, in respect of the publication<br>
under the authority of a parliamentary committee of any document laid<br>
before the committee or of any evidence given befo: re the committee.<br>
The Parliamentary Papers Act, which the bill proposes to amend, provides,<br>
amongst other things, that no action or proceedings, civil or criminal<br>
shall lie against any person for publishing any document published under<br>
the authority of the Senate or the House of Representatives. Tlhe act does<br>
not apply to publication under the authority of a parliamentary committee </p>
<p>but where the evidence given before a parliamentary committee is tabled<br>
in either House of the Parliament and ordered by that House to be printed<br>
the protection given by the act applies.<br>
However, when evidence is tabled and ordered to be printed, a large<br>
number of copies must be printed to meet the requirements of the circulation<br>
list for parliamentary papers. For example, on the tabling of the report<br>
of the Standing Committee on Broadcasting regarding proposed staff<br>
regulations for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the number of<br>
copies printed was 660. It is considered that the expense of printing the<br>
weidence before parliamentary committees as a parliamentary paper is not<br>
always justified. As an instance, the Standing Committee on Broadcasting<br>
considers that the number of copies of the evidence given before it which,<br>
generally speaking, need be printed is about 40. I feel sure that where a<br>
committee itself arranges the publication of evidence before it with the<br>
object of saving public money, it should not be deprived of the protection<br>
of the Parliamentary Papers Act. It may be that the publication is already<br>
privileged either at common law or by virtue of section 49 of the Commonwealth<br>
Constitution, but it is considered desirable to put the matter beyond<br>
doubt. The bill is designed to achieve this object and applies to documents<br>
; nd evidene, published after 23rd September, 1943."" [ The bill was passed.]<br>
ENEMY ALIENS.<br>
OVERSEAS INTERNEES-INQUIRY, MR. JUSTICE SIMPSON'S<br>
REPORT.<br>
In Parliament.-On 19th June, 1946, the Minister for Immigration<br>
Calwell) said-<br>
Mr. Justice Simpson was appointed by the Government to inquire<br>
into the cases of a number of enemy aliens who were still being held in<br>
internment. He was asked to report to the Government as to which<br>
persons should be released to remain in residence in this country, and as<br>
to which persons should be repatriated to their homelands. The Government<br>
has decided to carry out Mr. Justice Simpson's recommendations in<br>
their entirety. A number of perons are being held in internment pending<br>
repatriation they will be repatriated as soon as shipping is available.<br>
If shipping is not available before the expiration of the National Security<br>
Act, special legislation will be enacted to enable me to give effect to<br>
Mr. Justice Simpson's recommendations.""<br>
On 2nd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
When the National Security Act ceases on 31st December, 1946, there<br>
will be no power by which enemy aliens interned during the war and whose<br>
repatriation has been recommended by a Supreme Court judge in the<br>
interests of public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth can be<br>
repatriated. Further, because of lack of shipping, it may not be possible<br>
to give effect to the judge's recommendatious before the act expires.<br>
S"" Cabinet to-day decided that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)<br>
prepare a bill to provide for the repatriation of aliens who were interned </p>
<p>during the war and after an inquiry by a judicial authority are deemed to<br>
be a menace to the security of the Commonwealth the control of the movements<br>
of aliens interned during the war and released while awaiting<br>
repatriation following a judicial inquiry which deemed them to be a menace<br>
to the security of the Commonwealth and the repatriation of aliens who,<br>
after a judicial inquiry, are deemed to be a danger to the security of the<br>
Commonwealth."" NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.<br>
BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In PI'rliaentl.--On 19th June, 1946, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction<br>
( Mr. Dedman) introduced the Australian National University<br>
Bill. Mr. Dedman said--<br>
The Government is anxious that the national university which this<br>
bill seeks to establish should be established in such manner that it will bring<br>
credit to Australia, advance the cause of learning and research in general,<br>
and take its rightful place among the great universities of the world. For<br>
this reason I will sympathetically consider any amendment, with th,.<br>
object of helping the university achieve these ends.<br>
"" Australia has gained a justifiably high reputation in university<br>
teaching and research, and the Government believes that the establishment<br>
of an Australian national university at Canberra will bring still further<br>
credit to our country, not only by the work done within its own walls by its<br>
own staff and research students, but also by collaboration and co-operation<br>
between its members and the research workers and teachers of the other<br>
Australian universities. With the help and encouragement of other<br>
universities, anid of all men and women'of good will, the national university<br>
will soon be in a px: ition to take its share in solving many complex problems<br>
which are the joint responsibility of all universities.<br>
The establishment of a university is a matter of considerable complexity<br>
and a very great responsibility. For this reason the Government<br>
has not acted hastily. I have discussed the problems involved with the<br>
Minister for the Interior ( Mr. Johnson), with other Ministers concerned.<br>
with the Vice-Chancellors of the Universities of Sydney and Melbourne<br>
and with groups of distinguished scientists who have been called together<br>
by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Education to advise on the<br>
general and detailed questions associated with this project. In addition.<br>
the Government has had the help and advice of the Canberra University<br>
College Council.<br>
The essence of democratic government is that all national issues must<br>
ultimately be decided by the people themselves. To me it is more than<br>
ever important at tais stage in Australia's development that the Australian<br>
people should have available everything they need to permit their decisions<br>
to be made wisely and after a full understanding of the issues involved.<br>
Both in Australia and in the world at large, innumerable problems await<br>
solution if the future is to be made safe and the people placed in a position<br>
to enjoy the fruits of the developments in science and in human relationships<br>
during the last six years. The first thing that must be done is to </p>
<p>ensure that these developments are studied in relation particularly to their<br>
. Lpplication in Australia. Progress in physical science has culminated in<br>
the harnessing of atomic energy and this has brought the world to its final<br>
crossroads. Mishandled, these discoveries in the physical world can make<br>
peace and prosperity impossible. Properly used' they may introduce an<br>
era of happiness and prosperity unparalleled in world history. It is essential<br>
that Australia, in common with the other nations of the world, should do<br>
ieverything possible to foster that careful research which will allow us to<br>
become the masters, not the servants, of our physical environment. In<br>
medicine, too, the outstanding achievements of the war years await full and<br>
proper application to the civil needs of our people. Once again this implies<br>
patient research by all the talent at our disposal and demands the establishnient<br>
of appropriate institutions at which this research may be conducted.<br>
The Government feels that the university now proposed for Canberra is<br>
nHe appropriate place in which this research may be carried out. On the<br>
side of human relationships, our continued development, and a full under-<br>
-tanding of our problems, requires that we encourage research into the<br>
social sciences. Here, more than in any other field of learning, Australia<br>
lhas an outstanding contribution to make to the world at large. In<br>
economics, history, law, anthropology, and in all the related social sciences,<br>
Australia i n a particularly advantageous position.<br>
We lave also greatly increased responsibility to shoulder in relation<br>
to other people, and particularly to those with whom we are associated<br>
aI a Pacific power. The whole field of Pacific studies awaits fuller development<br>
than it has previously received in Australia. Our relations with the<br>
East, with the Americas, with the East Indies, New Zealand, New Guinea<br>
, ad all the Pacific islands, must be carefully studied so that they may<br>
l,' come friondly and fruitful if our future is to be safeguarded and if we<br>
to make our full contri! bution in the councils of the nations. Here,<br>
iur opportunities are unique. Our remoteness enables us to consider the<br>
fundamental issues involved, free from the day to day fears and turmoil<br>
tliht beset, many of the great Powers. For that reason we have a duty<br>
to the world at large which we must recognize if we are to be accepted as<br>
a world Power.<br>
The Iill is very straightforward and needs little amplification. It<br>
follows in broad outline the general plan of government which operates<br>
successfully in other universities, both in Australia and overseas. It will<br>
be noted that the functions of the university lay particular stress on postgraduate<br>
research and the research schools of immediate importance to<br>
Australia are set out, but nothing in the bill prevents the establishment<br>
of other research schools that may appear essential to the governing body<br>
f the university. It is recognized that facilities must be made available<br>
in Canberra to meet the increasing needs for undergraduate studies anud<br>
for special training for officers of government departments and provision<br>
is made to enablb this to be done.<br>
The governing authority of the university is to be council consisting<br>
of not more than 30 members and to be composed partly of elected members<br>
and partly of members appointed by the Govcrnor-General and by the </p>
<p>Parliament. The university must be free to administer its own affairs<br>
without any pressure from outside, otherwise decisions on highly complex<br>
technical matters may be taken which are not in the best interests of the<br>
university, and which may prevent it from carrying out its work efficiently.<br>
The appropriate safeguards against such outside interference are contained<br>
in the bill which specifically refers all matters connected with the<br>
government of the university to the council.<br>
"" I do not anticipate that the university will be in full operation for<br>
some time, but it is essential that as much basic planning as possible be<br>
completed so that the necessary plans can be laid for buildings and other<br>
essential work. The acute shortage of labour and materials for building<br>
will prevent an immediate start being made on any accommodation for the<br>
university. I propose that the bill be amended to permit the appointment<br>
of an interim council to carry out the work of the council until that body<br>
can be properly constituted and appointed, and in particular to undertake<br>
the preliminary work relating to the planning of the university.<br>
The Government is concerned that the university should be able to<br>
plan ahead, particularly cn its research side, and I propose to provide the<br>
university with a grant which will be reviewed every five years rather than<br>
to leave it dependent on the funds voted annually by Parliament. The<br>
Government proposes to make available in the first five years, commencing<br>
with the financial year 1951-52, the sum of œ 325,000 a year. The amount<br>
will be reviewed every five years thereafter. In the period before July,<br>
1951, such amount will be made available, to a maximum of œ 325,000 a<br>
year, as is actually needed to meet running expenses. The Government<br>
will provide sufficient funds to enable the university to start with buildings<br>
worthy of the objects for which they are built and in keeping with the best<br>
types of architecture in the Capital Territory. Accordingly the Government<br>
has approved œ 872,500 for buildings for the university. This amount<br>
will not be required immediately, nor will it be drawn from any one budget.<br>
The vice-chancellor, as the administrative head of the university,<br>
will be, in many ways, the key member of its staff. In the first instance,<br>
it is proposed that the vice-chancellor be appointed by the Governor-<br>
General for five years. All subsequent appointments to that office will<br>
be made by the council. It is vital that the vice-chancellor be a man of<br>
outstanding administrative ability, and, if possible, of high academic<br>
standing. I believe that he must at all costs secure men of world reputation<br>
to supervise the work of the various research schools."" [ The bill was passed.]<br>
COAL-MINING INDUSTRY.<br>
CONTROL-COAL CLIFF COLLIERY.<br>
In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Supply ( Senator<br>
Ashley) said that losses in the operation of Coal Cliff colliery by the Commonwealtb<br>
had been-<br>
Year ended March, 1945, œ 28,350; year ended March, 1946, œ 27,652. </p>
<p>LITERARY CENSORSHIP BOARD.<br>
MEMBERS RE-APPOINTED.<br>
On 20th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) announced that<br>
Dr. L. H. Allen ( chairman), Prof. J. F. M. Haydon and Mr. K. Binns had<br>
been re-appointed members of the Literature Censorship Board for three<br>
years from 25th June, 1946. Sir Robert Garran had been re-appointed<br>
Appeal Censor for the same period from the same date.<br>

POST-WAR-RIFLE CLUBS.<br>
In Parlirmeni.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for the Army ( Mr.<br>
Forde) said--<br>
The Government has authorized the re-establishment of rifle clubs as<br>
from 1st July, 1946. The departmental organization for the administration<br>
of the rifle club movement will be on the lines in force before 1931, when<br>
the rifle clubs were a civil movement under the Department of Defence.<br>
POST-WAR-BRITISH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.<br>
On 27th June, 1946, the acting Minister for Defence ( Mr. Forde)<br>
announced that Lieutenant-Generals S. F. Rowell, C. A. Clowes and F. H.<br>
Berrvnan, and Brigadier R. King would attend a defence conference of the<br>
commanders-in-chief of all British army commands at home and overseas<br>
and of representatives of the Dominions in Britain in August, 1946.<br>
WOOL.<br>
MANUFACTURES-SUBSIDY.<br>
On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) announced<br>
that subsidy would be paid to maintain existing prices of wool to Australian<br>
manufacturers for utilization in goods for domestic consumption, when<br>
auction sales recommenced after 30th June, 1946. The purpose of the<br>
subsidy was to enable Australian manufacturers to compete with overseas<br>
buyers in a manner that will avoid interference with normal auction purchases.<br>
Subsidies would be paid to manufacturers to re-imburse any excess<br>
paid in purchasing at prices for domestic consumption but not in excess<br>
of the average market level for individual wool types at a series of auction<br>
sales. That ensured that manufacturers would not bid extravagantly on<br>
the assumption that the Conunmmonwealth Government would meet deficiencies<br>
resulting from unlimited bidding.<br>
WHEAT STABILIZATION SCHEME.<br>
POST-WAR-BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr.<br>
Scully) introduced the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill. Mr. Scully<br>
said-Wheat has been a troubled industry for many years. For a decade<br>
before the war, it was frequently in a depressed condition and constant<br>
assistance from governments was. required. Prices were low and growers </p>
<p>could not obtain a reasonable living from their labour. Other wheatproducing<br>
countries were in a similar plight, and wheat presented the<br>
world's greatest agricultural problem. The need for stabilization in Australia<br>
was recognized, but it is beyond the power of any Commonwealth<br>
Iovernment to stabilize the industry. Joint action by all Australian<br>
governments is necessary, because both States and Commonwealth are<br>
vitally affected by matters concerning the wheat inditstry. Although the<br>
prcblem is old, to date it has not been possible to get agreement on a plan,<br>
and the method of operating it.<br>
The bill is intended to give security to the wheat industry in Australia.<br>
It provides growers with a guaranteed minimum price for wheat for five<br>
years, and has the machinery to maintain minimum price guarantees as a<br>
permanent feature. The effect will be to remove the feature which disturbed<br>
the industry most in the past; that is, the impact of unduly low<br>
prices. It will be replaced by a system under which wheat farmers will<br>
know, for a period of years in advance, that they will receive a definite<br>
price for their wheat. They can plan their farm programme with an assured<br>
return, and with the knowldge that they will not be ruined by market<br>
changes which cannot be foreseen or controlled. The stabilization proposals<br>
represent the considered judgment of governments and growers, first, as to<br>
the measures needed for tlh industry, and, second, as to the best way to<br>
effect them. Co-operation with the States is an essential part of the plan.<br>
The States control production, and production must be regulated according<br>
to the markets available for our wheat. In marketing, Commonwealth and<br>
States must use their constitutional powers in harmony if the plan is to be<br>
effective; neither can provide effective marketing unaided. In the plan<br>
now proposed. the States have shown their willingness to co-operate with<br>
the Commonwealth. It has been discussed in detail with State Gove lnmn.-<br>
its, and they have agreed to bring complementary legislation befdre<br>
their parliaments. The Government has consulted wheat-growers' organizations.<br>
The' plan was discussed with the Wheat Growers' Federation in<br>
December, 1945, and growers' views on its details were then expounded<br>
fully. The various points stressed received consideration and it has been<br>
possible to meet them in full. The bill represents the greatest practicable<br>
measure of co-operation between governments and growers to settle the<br>
problem of the wheat industry.<br>
The plan provides a miinimum guaranteed price for wheat for the<br>
period 1945-46 to 1949-50. It provides for review during the currency<br>
of the scheme, with a view to its extension beyond the five years. Growers<br>
will contribute to ai stabilization fund, when prices are high, and the<br>
contribution will be not more than 50 per cent. of the excess of the export<br>
price above the guaranteed minimum price. The Commonwealth will<br>
meet any deficiency in any one year should the stabilization fund become<br>
exhausted. A central marketing organization will be responsible for the<br>
marketing of the Australian wheat crop, and production will be regulated<br>
in accordance with thl markets available. The guaranteed price for the<br>
seasons 1945-46 to 19,19-50, is 5s. 2d. a bushel f. o. r. ports for f. a. q. bagged<br>
wheat. This miinimum will apply to the whole of the marketed crops. </p>
<p>At present, a home-consumption price applies to wheat used locally for<br>
flour. This will be extended to cover other wheat used locally. There is;<br>
in addition, the very important point of the guarantee for export wheat.<br>
Control over local wheat prices is always possible, but the grower will now<br>
get protection against slumps which have been a regular feature of world<br>
markets, and the Commonwealth will take a financial risk to give that<br>
protection. It is intended that the guaranteed price will apply for five<br>
seasons, but, . before the period is up, the plan will be reviewed, and a fresh<br>
guarantee given for a further period. The intention is to have regular<br>
reviews, and to maintain always a guaranteed price for some seasons ahead.<br>
The first period has been fixed as a reasonable period of security and a<br>
reasonable period for a fixed commitment. The guaranteed price is the<br>
minimum return, and growers will get more when export prices are high.<br>
They are given a definite floor price.<br>
A contribution from growers is provided for. It is considered that,<br>
in principle, a government guarantee, which is really a guarantee from the<br>
taxpayer should be accompanied by contributions from growers when<br>
prices are high. This principle is accepted by growers and a 50-50 contribution<br>
is generally conceded to be fair. When prices are high, growers will<br>
contribute up to 50 per cent. of the excess above the guaranteed price of<br>
export wlheat. The money so subscribed will go into a stabilization fund,<br>
and will be used to meet the guarantee when prices fall. The fund will<br>
be a trust fund. There is no intention of building up an excessively large<br>
fund, and, if prices remain higher than is now expected, the contribution<br>
will be reduced below 50 per cent. The effect is that growers will make a<br>
reasonable but not an excessive contribution, and the Commonwealth will<br>
meet the guarantee if a run of low prices exhausts the fund. This means<br>
that growers will share in the extra amounts from high price years, and are<br>
assured in advance against a price below 5s. 21.<br>
It is not proposed, that returns shall be permanently out of line with<br>
the export price, nor that the industry will be continually subsidized. Twothirds<br>
of our wheat goes on to the export market, and we must compete<br>
with other countries for our markets. The plan gives time for adjustments<br>
to meet changing world conditions, and it protects growers against a rapid<br>
fall on the export market. It cannot relieve them of the need to meet<br>
world competition in the export trade. It is hoped, however, that an<br>
effective internatiolal agreement will protect . export markets in future.<br>
For the next five years, come what may in the export field, growers are<br>
guaranteed against the effect of a world slump. They will not receive in<br>
any one of the five years less than 5s. 2d.<br>
The difficulties of making a guarantee effective can hardly be overcome<br>
without a central organization for marketing. A wheat board will be set<br>
up to handle and sell the crops with the benefits of war-time experience<br>
and of an efficient organization. The board will succeed the war-time Wheat<br>
Board and carry on its -work. In its new set-up it will operate under joint<br>
powers conferred by Commonwealth and States, and the statutory power<br>
to operate will relate almost entirely to wheat covered by the State acts.<br>
Regulation of production is a part of the plan in which action would<br>
be impossible without full State co-operation. The long history of wheat </p>
<p>gluts and wheat shortages has shown how easy it is to go from one extreme<br>
to the other. Wheat gluts build up fast, and the low prices which result<br>
have had a disastrous effect in past years on wheat farmers here and overseas.<br>
Over-production must be avoided in the future. We wish to produce all<br>
the wheat we reasonably can, and to sell it at a price fair to growers and<br>
consumers. We want to avoid temporary high-price expansion in the<br>
industry which would leave it over-capitalized and unable to carry on when<br>
prices recede. Deliberate regulation according to markets available is a<br>
new departure, but it offers the best prospect for avoiding a return to the<br>
disastrous see-saw from glut to scarcity. It may seem odd at present to<br>
be thinking of regulating wheat production. Australia is now trying to<br>
produce the maximum crop and to supply everything possible to meet overseas<br>
needs. But we must prepare for whatever may come in the future,<br>
and it is likely that, within a short time, a wheat glut may recur. If it<br>
does, farmers will again be faced with depression, and precautions against<br>
that must be taken now.<br>
Normal pre-war basis of production can be maintained and it will be<br>
practicable to include in the industry soldier settlers and farmers' sons.<br>
I hope that conditions of world trade in the years to come will give an<br>
outlet for all the wheat which Australia can produce. If so, there will be<br>
room for expansion to the limit of economic productive capacity. It must,<br>
however, be realized that farmers cannot go into the wheat industry one<br>
season, and out of it the next. Once in it, they are committed to heavy<br>
outlay and years of production. Boom years are a menace because of the<br>
danger of high land prices and over-capitalized farms, leading to a financial<br>
structure which is not able to meet low or medium price years. For that<br>
reason, the production basis must be decided with the greatest care. The<br>
plan is intended to make the wheat industry sound financially. Regublltion<br>
Sof production-not restriction of production-has been recognized over<br>
the years us one requisite for any plan. That is recognized not only by<br>
governmnts but by the growers; and growers are willing to co-operate<br>
in regulation of the industry to secure the wide benefits of stabilization.<br>
Regulation of production was brought in as a war-time measure, and now<br>
can readily be adapted to peace-time needs. It is a State function, and<br>
Commonwealth and States will co-operate to secure uniformity in administration.<br>
There aire two Commoniwealth bills, and complementary legislation<br>
will be necessary in each State. It is considered the State legislation can<br>
be covered by one act, and one object of the discussions was to secure<br>
uniformity among the States. The Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill<br>
provides the mechanism for carrying out the plan I have outlined, and for<br>
co-operating with the States in all necessary matters. The Wheat Export<br>
Charge Bill completes the work by providing for the charge which forms the<br>
Urowers' contribution to the hill. Difficult problems will be met in administration.<br>
I am confident that they will be overcome by the partnership of<br>
Commonwealth and States.<br>
The Wheat Charges Bill, to be introduced later, provides for a maximum<br>
contribution of 50 per cent., or a lower rate if prescribed, of the difference<br>
between the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. and the average export price in </p>
<p>; any one year or such part of the export price as is prescribed. It is proposed<br>
for the 1945--46 crop, that the contribution be 50 per cent. of the difference<br>
between 5s. 2d. and 9s. 6d. bagged. The average export return isestimated<br>
to be ] 0s. Growers will be paid from the pool on the following basis:-<br>
2d. a bushel for domestically consumed wheat, and for export wheat<br>
2d. a bushel plus 50 per cent. of the difference between 5s. 2d., the guaranteed<br>
price, and 9s. 6d.-which is 2s. 2d. and a further 6d. on export<br>
wheat, this being the difference between 10s. and 9s. 6d. It is estimated<br>
that, for the whole of the wheat marketed local and export, the grower will<br>
receive 6s. 7d. a bushel f. o. r. at ports bagged.<br>
Summarized, the two bills provide-<br>
The preservation over five years of a price of 5s. 2d. a bushel f. o. r. at ports. bagged<br>
for all wheat consumed within Australia.<br>
A guarantee by the Government of a minimum price for export of 5s. 2d. a bushel<br>
f. o. r. at ports bagged.<br>
When the export price exceeds the guaranteed price, growers to contribute to a<br>
fund to an amount not exceeding 50 per cent. of the difference between the export price<br>
and the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d.<br>
When the export price falls below 5s. 2d., the fund will be called upon to provide<br>
the amount necessary to bring the export price up to 5s. 2d.<br>
If and when the fund is exhausted in any one year, the Government under its<br>
guarantee will provide, out of general revenue, the funds necessary to bring export prices<br>
up to 5s. 2d.<br>
For the 1945-46 crop, the Government proposes that the grower will be paid on<br>
export wheat 5s. 2d., plus 2s. 2d., plus the excess of export returns over 9s. 6d. Under<br>
this arrangement, it is calculated that, for the whole of his sales, export and local, the<br>
grower will receive 6s. 7d. a bushel f. o. r. at ports bagged.<br>
The scheme, including the guarantee, is to operate for five years. During its<br>
: urrency, however, reviews will be made with a view to continuing it under conditions<br>
which may or may not be revised, beyond five years.<br>
The plan is designed to provide for stabilized returns over a period of years. Funds<br>
will be held on account of growers in years of high prices and paid out in years of low<br>
prices. But the Government underwrites the scheme to the extent of guaranteeing<br>
that, whatever be the rise or fall of the market over five years, the farmer will get a<br>
return not less than 5s. 2d. a bushel f. o. r. bagged at ports. [ The bill was passed.]<br>

EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS.<br>
FUTURE POLICY-TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Information<br>
( Mr. Calwell) introduced the Overseas Telecommunications Bill. Mr.<br>
Calwell said-<br>
This bill deals with the transfer to national ownership of the external<br>
telecommunication services now owned and operated by Amalgamated<br>
Wireless ( Australasia) Limited and the establishment of a statutory<br>
corporation to operate both radio and cable services linking Australia with<br>
other countries. This bill is one of similar pieces of legislation which will<br>
be enacted by the parliaments of all self-governing countries in the British<br>
Commonwealth and Empire. The step being taken in Australia is part<br>
of a unified plan. recommended by the British Commonwealth Telecominunications<br>
Conference in July and August, 1945. The conference reached<br>
the unanimous conclusion that, to secure the desired strengthening and </p>
<p>better ordering of the British Commonwealth telecommunications system,<br>
a fundamental change in the present organization was necessary. The<br>
conference recommended-<br>
That the private shareholder interest in the ownership of overseas telecommunication<br>
services of Britain, the Dominions and India should be replaced by public ownership.<br>
That the government in each country should acquire the ownership of the telecom.<br>
munication assets in its territories.<br>
That the type of organization established in each country to own and operate the<br>
external telecommunication services should as far as possible be uniform.<br>
That a Commonwealth Telecommunication Board be established to replace the<br>
Commonwealth Communications Council, with functions mainly advisory in character.<br>
but extending to all the national organizations throughout the Empire instead of being<br>
related only to the London organization as under present conditions.<br>
The conference also worked out a system of pooling of net revenues.<br>
in a central fund, from which out-payments for the maintenance of the<br>
board and the maintenance of the submrine cables could be met, after<br>
which the residues would be returned to the respective national bodies.<br>
Legislation to give effect to the recommendations of the conference<br>
has been introduced in the British House of Commons and provides for the<br>
acquisition of the shares of Cable and Wireless Limited, apart from the<br>
2,600,000 shares which it already owns, : nd the payment of compensation<br>
to the shareholders. Another bill is to be introduced later for the establishment<br>
of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board and for the carrying<br>
into effect of the full scheme recommended by the 1945 conference.<br>
The bill before this House provides for the full implementation of the<br>
recommendations of the conference and the ratification of an overall agreement<br>
in the form set out in the first schedule to the bill. The bill provides<br>
for the establishment in Australia of a government commission as a<br>
corporate body, to acquire the ownership of and to maintain and operate<br>
the overseas telecommunication services at present conducted by Amalgamated<br>
Wireless ( Australasia) Limited and by Cable and Wireless Limited<br>
in the -territories of the Commonwealth of Australia. The commission will<br>
be called the Overseas Telecommunications Commission ( Australia).<br>
Provision is made for the assessment of the compensation which will he<br>
payable to Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia) Limited. The bill provides<br>
that the amount may be determined by agreement between the commission<br>
and the company. In the event of agreement not being reached, the<br>
amount may be determined by a compensation board. If either party is<br>
dissatisfied with the amount of compensation determined by the board,<br>
an appeal may be made to the High Court. The assets of Cable and Wireless<br>
Limited to be taken over by the commission will be transferred by the<br>
British Govermnent to the commission at an agreed price to be paid in cash<br>
Employees of the two companies who have been exclusively employed<br>
by them on telecommunications in Australia for three years or over, and<br>
for whom suitable employment can be found by the commission, will become<br>
entitled to appointment to positions in the service of the commission, with<br>
preservation of their accrued pension, superannuation, furlough and other<br>
rights. If it is not found possible to re-engage all the employees affected.<br>
it is proposed to come to an arrangement with the companies so that the<br>
employees affected will not be placed at a disadvantage. </p>
<p>The commission will acquire, operate and maintain all the overseas<br>
telecommunication services hitherto owned and operated in Australia by<br>
Cable and Wireless Limited and Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia)<br>
Limited, including in the latter case the operation of coastal and island<br>
radio stations which handle wireless traffic with ships at sea and similar<br>
traffic exchanged within and between territories of the Commonwealth.<br>
The national corporations throughout the Empire will undertake research<br>
: tad developmental work to improve the efficiency of services. This work<br>
will be co-ordinated by the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board in<br>
London, and that board will also undertake research work on behalf of all<br>
partner governments. It is contemplated that the commission shall, if<br>
so desired by another national body, undertake to act as agent on agreed<br>
terms in maintaining and operating overseas telecommunication services in<br>
regional areas adjacent to Australia.<br>
Power is conferred on the Miiister to approve of any contracts where<br>
-upply, either directly or indirectly, of imported equipment or material<br>
of a value exceeding œ 5,000 is involved. This provision will ensure that<br>
lue consideration is given by the commission to the use of equipment manuf1ctured<br>
in Australia before steps are taken to import material of any<br>
ippreciable value from abroad. The powers conferred on the commission<br>
io not detract in any way from those entrusted to the Minister administering<br>
the Wireless Telegrapliy and the Post and Telegraph Acts.<br>
Conditions under which advances will be made to the commission shall<br>
be determined by the Treasurer. The form in which the commission will<br>
keep its accounts will be subject to the approval of the Treasurer and to<br>
inspection and audit by the Auditor-General. Annual reports and financial<br>
statements of the commission, accompanied by a certificate of the Auditor-<br>
(' cncral. will be submitted to Parliament.<br>
The c-inmluission will arrange free handling of meteorological telegrams<br>
exchanged with ships at sea and of similar messages exchanged between<br>
Commonwealth meteorological offices and stations. The commission will<br>
handle free on behalf of the Post Office other telegrams for transmission<br>
within the Commonwealth in cases cf interruption to land-lines, in return<br>
for which the Post Office will arrange free transmission of messages relating<br>
to the commission's administrative affairs.<br>
The duties and functions of the Commonwealth Telecommunications<br>
Board are set out in detail in the overall agreement which becomes a part<br>
of the bill. The costs of the board are to be met in agreed proportions<br>
from the net revenues of the several national bodies.<br>
In the overall agreement, a form of tripartite agreement is drawn up<br>
for execution in due course by each partner government concerned, the<br>
Commonwealth Telecommunications Board and the local national telecommunications<br>
body. This tripartite agreement defines the relationship<br>
which will exist between the several parties thereto and, in particular, to<br>
mutual responsibilities of the local national body and the Commonwealth<br>
Telecommunications Board. It provides for the establishment of a central<br>
fund into which the national bodies will pay annually their net revenues. </p>
<p>"" Of the subscribed capital in Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia)<br>
Limited, amounting to œ 985,518, the Government owns 500,001 fully paid<br>
shares and private interests 485,517 shares. Under the agreements to which<br>
I have referred the measure of control exercisable by the Government is<br>
incommensurate with its majority shareholding. The agreements are so<br>
greatly in favour of the company that, apart from approval or veto of'<br>
tariffs and the granting or withholding of licences for new services and--<br>
even this later right by the Government has been denied by the company-.<br>
the Government has virtually little or no control at all over the policy of th,<br>
company. Government representation on the Board of Directors is limited<br>
to three out of a total of seven directors constituting the board. Effective<br>
co-ordination and control of overseas telecommunication services in<br>
Australia in the national interest is impracticable of realization so long as<br>
two separate companies own and operate the two respective means of<br>
overseas communication, cable and radio. The transfer of the services of'<br>
both companies to the Government will enable their complete co-ordination<br>
under a single operating authority, and will ultimately enable cheaper rates<br>
to be offered to the users of the services through the avoidance of existing<br>
duplication of effort and of overhead costs resulting from the conduct of<br>
the respective services by two separate undertakings. The acquisition by<br>
the Government of the telecommunication assets of Amalgamated Wireless<br>
( Australasia) Limited will involve a reconstitution of the company to enable<br>
it to continue as a manufacturing, commercial broadcasting and patentholding<br>
sales and servicing organization. The Government proposes to<br>
retain its proportionate shareholding in the reconstituted company, if the<br>
private shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia) Limited so<br>
desire. Provision for this would not be appropriate in this bill, and<br>
suitable steps towards this end will be taken later, if necessary.""<br>

WOOL AGREEMENT.<br>
NEW AGREEMENT-JOINT ORGANIZATION, FIRST MEETING..<br>
On 23rd June, 1.946, the Prime Miniister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
"" The first meetings of the Dominion and British directors of United<br>
Kingdom-Dominion Wool Disposals Limited have been held in London.<br>
The company has been entrusted by the Governments of Britain, Australia,<br>
New Zealand and South Africa with the double task of effecting orderl * y<br>
disposal of accumulated war-time surpluses of wool and at the same tim' 4<br>
maintaining anl appropriate degree of stability in prices.<br>
It will attempt to achieve the first objective by offerinc, at auctionl<br>
its stocks of wool alongside current clips in accordance with supply and<br>
demand in the world's markets and to achieve the second objective by<br>
regulation of offerings and by means of reserve ' prices at which it will be<br>
prepared to buy in growers' wool at auction. It will, at all times, endeavour<br>
to act impartially towards tbe interests of the various parts affected or<br>
likely to be affected by its decisions and the company makes the following<br>
preliminary announcement:<br>
His Majesty's Governments in Britain, Australia, New Zealand<br>
and South Africa have considered the recommendation made by tho<br>
Joint Organization pursuant to the terms of paragraph 6 of the Wool<br>
Disposals Plan and have decided that the initial general level of<br>
reserve prices for DoiioDs' Wools sold in the Dominions shall be<br>
the same as tbe present average selling price, ex store, in the<br>
Dominion concerned. It is the intention that this inlitial level shall,<br>
in the absence of circumstances at present quite unforeseen, be<br>
maintained throughout the wool year 1946-47.<br>
Individual reserve prices for the wool year 1946-47, apart fronm<br>
exceptional cases, will not be changed throughout the year.<br>
The sale of wool at fixed prices b or on behalf of, the Joint<br>
Organization will cease on 30th June, 1946.<br>
Orders agaiinst which allocation of wool has no~ t been made, oil<br>
or before 30th June, 1946, will be cancelled. </p>
<p>Sales by auction will commence in Australia at the beginning of<br>
September, in South Africa at the beginning of September, in New<br>
Zealand of crutchings and of old wool at the beginning of September<br>
and of new wool in November, and in Britain in September. The<br>
precise dates on which auctions will commence and details of the<br>
selling programme will he announced later.<br>
Details in broad technical descriptions of the stock estimated to be<br>
held by the organization at 30th June, 1946, will be announced as soon as<br>
possible."" On 27th June, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Scully) announced<br>
that the Wool ( Contributory Charge) Assessment Act and the Wool<br>
( Contributory Charge) Act, assented to on 11th October, 1945, as an<br>
essential part of the plan for the stabilized marketing of accumulated stocks<br>
of wool in conjunction with current clips, had been proclaimed to operate<br>
as from 1st July, 1946.<br>
In Parliament.-On 27th June, 1946, Mr. Scully said-<br>
The agreement between the Governments of Britain; Australia, New<br>
Zealand and South Africa for the disposal of accumulated stocks of wool<br>
and of oncoming clips provided for decisions by the four Governments,<br>
of a reserve price for the season, below which sales would not be made, and<br>
for a contributory charge which would be struck in each country to meet<br>
the industry's share of the cost of administration. The general reserve<br>
price agreed upon is that price at which wool is at present being sold<br>
ex store. For Australia, this is, on average, 18. l1 ( Aust.) a lb. The<br>
contributory charge decided upon by the Comuonwealth Government is<br>
per cent. of the value of the wool, which works out at .91d. ( Aust.) a lb.<br>
average. The price of 18.15d. a lb., less the cnurributory charge of .91l., gives<br>
a net average return of 17.24d. and this is 1.79d. ( Aust.) more than<br>
the average price of 15.45d. ( Aust.) over the whole clip payable by Britain<br>
under the war-time agreement. This must be considered very satisfactory<br>
to growers, because it gives to them, in effect, an overall minimum<br>
guaranteed return substantially greater than that received by them under<br>
the war-time contract."" WAR ARCHIVES.<br>
On 25th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
In 1942, the then Prime Minister ( the late Mr. Curtin) formed a War<br>
Archives Committee under the chairmanship of Dr. C. E. W. Bean, who<br>
was historian of World War to investigate measures for the preservation<br>
of Australian records and documents relating to World War II.<br>
I have now approved of the scope of the committee being broadened<br>
so that its functions include the preservation of all Conunonwealth records<br>
and not only records relating to the war. The committee will be known<br>
as the Commonwealth Archives Committee. Its functions will be to study<br>
archival principles and practices and to submit recommendations for the<br>
establishment, when circunistances permit, of a permanent archival system </p>
<p>23<br>
for the Commonwealth. Pending the establishment of such system, it will<br>
advise the Government on general questions of collection and preservation.<br>
of records, for the collection or preservation of which adequate steps are<br>
not being taken by a Commonwealth authority, and will formulate proposals<br>
for the preservation of records and documents or Commonwealth<br>
departments, and lay down broad principles to be observed by Commonwealth<br>
departments and provisional archival authorities. The members of<br>
the committee will be---<br>
Dr. Bean ( chairman), Messrs. H. S. Temby ( Prime Minister's Department).<br>
P. Hasluck ( Department of External Affairs), J. G. B. Castieau ( Attorney-General's<br>
Department), K. Binns ( Commonwealth Librarian), LL-Colonel J. L. Treloar ( Director.<br>
Australian War Memorial), Mr. A. W. Bazley ( Assistant Director, Historical Records,<br>
Australian War Memorial), and a representative of the Department of the Interior.<br>
TEXTILE TRADE.<br>
WOOLLEN TEXTILES--EXPORTS.<br>
On 26th June, 19416, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) said<br>
that export of woollen cloths related to all woollen and worsteds and<br>
included shipments to Unrra as well as commercial exports. Of the<br>
3,000,000 square yards exported during the current trade year, about<br>
2,000,000 square yards of woollen piece goods went to Unrra, and a large<br>
quantity of it was stock the trade was glad to dispose of as it was unsaleable<br>
in Australia. The remaining 1,000,000 square yards of commercial exports<br>
of woollen and worsted piece goods represented only 4 per cent. of the<br>
total production of woollens and worsteds and included all types of woollen<br>
cloth. Suitings exported represented only a small proportion as the<br>
Governmeut -had established strict quotas for worsted exports. Apart<br>
from a small quota to New Zealand, the only exports of worsteds were on<br>
a token basis to maintain overseas markets.<br>
BUDGET, 1945-46.<br>
APPROPRIATION BILL-EXCESS REVENUE.<br>
In Parliament.-On 26th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley)<br>
introduced the Appropriation Bill. Mr. Chifley said-<br>
The purpose of this bill is to obtain parliamentary appropriation for<br>
the expenditure of an additional œ 20,000,000 of revenue for war purposes.<br>
When the budget was presented in September, 1945, I estimated that total<br>
revenue would be œ 374,000,000. The. budget was framed to provide an<br>
appropriation from revenue for non-war items aggregating œ 166,000,000.<br>
The balance of œ 208,000,000 was appropriated for war purposes.<br>
It is now anticipated that some revenue items will exceed the estimate.<br>
With the end of the war and the relaxation of controls, there has been a<br>
marked buoyancy in customs and excise revenue, and indications are that<br>
the estimate will he exceeded by œ 7,000,000. Increased sales of civilian<br>
goods, mainly due to demobilization of the forces, may result in an increase<br>
of sales tax revenue of œ 5,000,000. Income tax may yield an increased<br>
amount of œ 5,000,000. Estate duty and s: ome other items of revenue will<br>
show small increases. </p>
<p>It is anticipated that non-war expenditure will be approximately the<br>
same as the budget estimate. An accurate forecast of the total revenue<br>
for 1945-16 is difficult, but the improvement will be from œ 15,000,000 to<br>
œ 20,000,000. To permit this increase of revenue to be utilized to meet<br>
war expenditure, it is necessary to provide an additional appropriation<br>
of œ 20,000,000. The budget provided for total war expenditure of<br>
œ 360,000,000. Owing mainly to the acceleration of demcbilization, this<br>
estimate will be exceeded. The appropriation of œ 20,000,000 will enable<br>
the actual improvement of revenue to be applied to war expenditure, thus<br>
reducing the amount chargeable to loan."" [ The bill was passed.]<br>
IMPORTS.<br>
CIGARETTE PAPERS.<br>
On 26th June, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) announced<br>
that, in view of the shortage of cigarette papers in Australia, licences would<br>
be issued for the importation of reasonable quantities of cigarette papers.<br>
BANKING CONTROL.<br>
LEGISLATION-COMMONWEALTH BANK ACT, INDUSTRIAL<br>
DEPARTMENT.<br>
In Parliament.-On 26th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley)<br>
said that to 20th March, 1946, applications to the Industrial Loan Department<br>
of the Commonwealth Bank totalled 964. of which 782 had been dealt<br>
with. Applications totalling 501 and involving œ 78, T738 had been granted.<br>

GOVERNMENT'S PLAN-NATIONAL WORKS COUNCIL, LOCAL<br>
GOVERNMENT AREAS.<br>
On 1st July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
SThe question has beeni asked whether the Commnonwealth Government<br>
would give financial assistance to local authorities to implement their plans<br>
for local works, improvemlents and facilities, or arrange For the granting<br>
of interest free loans to such bodies. </p>
<p>26<br>
It must be remembered that these local authorities are self-governing<br>
bodies, responsible to the electors, and that powers exist under State law<br>
for them to raise loans, as well as obtain revenue by the levying of rates.<br>
As to concessional interest rates, I think it would be difficult to justify the<br>
selection of one class of borrowing for favoured treatment in this respect.<br>
Moreover, a concession to one class of borrowers presents the problem of<br>
adjusting upwards the rates to other borrowers if a net loss in interest<br>
receipts from all advances--involving an additional charge on the Budget--<br>
is to be avoided.<br>
The Commonwealth Government is aware of the problems associated<br>
with the financing of public work programmes and has actively pursued a<br>
policy which will provide the most favorable terms over the widest field<br>
of prospective borrowers. I refer particularly to the fact that borrowings<br>
by governments, and semi-and local government authorities, may now be<br>
negotiated on more favorable terms than ever before and this is directly<br>
. ttributable to the policy of low interest rates by the Commonwealth.<br>
It is essential to the continued success of financial policy, that all<br>
. pproaches to the market for loan funds should be properly co-ordinated.<br>
This is particularly important during the next few years, when it will be<br>
necessary to introduce the public works requirements of Commonwealth,<br>
State and local government bodies in an ordered way so as to avoid undue<br>
, competition for available building and works facilities. Similarly, it is<br>
-sscntial that financial needs be co-ordinated and related to available money.<br>
The fact that the Commonwealth, foreseeing these potential needs,<br>
: onvened the National Works Council, and was instrumental in having a<br>
long-term public works programme planned by the States, must not be<br>
interpreted as an indication that the Commonwealth Government desires to<br>
usurp the sovereign responsibilities of the States in the field of local government,<br>
nor that it is prepared to support a financial arrangement which<br>
would give strong preference to local government bodies in respect of public<br>
works finance which could not be extended to other Commonwealth and<br>
State financial requirements for public works and buildings programmes.<br>
At its first meeting in January, 1944, the National Works Council<br>
agreed to. the preparation of a programme of public works in three classifications<br>
of urgency and amounting in all to roughly œ 200,000,000 as a reservoir<br>
of worhs to facilitate the stabilization of the early post-war economic<br>
condition. It was resolved that the programme for each State should be<br>
endorsed by that State Government and that the administering authority<br>
of the programme should indicate its agreement to accept the financial<br>
responsibility entailed. Among the items included in the States' programmes<br>
would be works planned by local government authorities and<br>
authorized by the State Government concerned as sufficiently urgent to be<br>
included in its programme. At the second meeting of the National Works<br>
Council in August, 1944, progress was reviewed and it was again emphasized<br>
that the responsibility for the financing of the works programmes planned<br>
rested on the States. Local government authorities should, therefore,<br>
submit their loan proposals to their State Governments."" </p>

UNITED NATIONS FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATIONAUSTRALIAN<br>
BODY.<br>
On 2nd July, 1946, Mr. Chifley said---<br>
The Fcod and Agriculture Organization is now becoming effectively<br>
established as an integral part of the new international machinery of the<br>
United Nations. The first conference, to which Australia sent a delegation,<br>
was held in 1945. Following the conference, steps have been taken to build<br>
up a permanent secretariat to carry out its functions.<br>
In 1944, Full Cabinet approved of an inter-departmental committee<br>
being established, comprising representatives of the Departments of the<br>
Treasury, External Affairs, Post-war Reconstruction, Commerce and Agriculture,<br>
and Health, to consider matters associated with the subject as<br>
they arose and to report to the Minister for External Affairs. A request<br>
has now been received from the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture<br>
Organization that an Australian committee be set up to provide a<br>
liaison between the appropria: e agencies in Australia and the secretariat<br>
of the organization.<br>
"" Cabinet decided to-day that the Inter-departmental Committee be<br>
S replaced by an Australian Food and Agriculture Organization Committee<br>
to be set up in conformity with the request of the Director-General of F. A. O.,<br>
comprising representatives of the Departments of the Treasury, External<br>
S Affairs, Commerce and Agriculture, Information, Interior, Health, and of<br>
the Bureau of Agricultural Economics ( now with the Department of Post-<br>
S war Reconstruction), the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,<br>
the Commonwealth Statistician, and the Forestry and Timber Bureau.<br>
The Australian F. A. O. Committee has the following duties and responsibilities<br>
To advise the Government on policy questions in regard to F. A. O.<br>
To collect information and statistics required by the F. A. O. secretariat from<br>
Australia and to approve such matter before despatch.<br>
To disseminate information provided by F. A. O.<br>
To bring to the notice of appropriate authorities any action required on their part<br>
S to carry out the purposes of F. A. O.<br>
To prepare the draft brief for Australian representatives attending conferences and<br>
other meetings of the F. A. O.<br>
To furnish a quarterly progress report to Cabinet and to report at other times as<br>
circumstances require.<br>
To arrange suitable publicity for F. A. O. activities through the Department of<br>
Information.<br>
S To co-operate with State authorities through the Department of Commerce and<br>
Agriculture and the Australian Agricultural Council.<br>
WORLD ORGANIZATION--ATOMIC ENERGY.<br>
In Parliament.-On 3rd July, 1946, Mr. Chifley said--<br>
On the general subject of the control of atomic energy and the materials<br>
used in the manufacture of atomic bombs, a conference has been sitting for<br>
some time. The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) is representing<br>
Australia. I cannot say what final decisions are likely to be reached, but<br>
the general view has been expressed by this Government, and has been<br>
submitted to the conference, that the control of atomic energy should be<br>
placed under the United Nations. Having regard to the dreadful possibilities<br>
of the use of uranium and other ingredients in the production of </p>
<p>atomic bombs, and to the future peace of the world, our belief is that this<br>
new discovery should be developed to produce industrial power and not<br>
hombs for war purposes. Dr. Evatt is making this clear at the conference.""<br>
SECONDARY INDUSTRIES COMMISSION-PLYWOOD INDUSTRY<br>
PANEL.<br>
On 3rd July, 1946, Mr. Dedman announced the formation of a Plywood<br>

that as from 1st July, 1946, control of the end use of tinplate, which had<br>

On 28th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chilley) said that staterients<br>
comparing the level of taxation in Australia with that of other<br>
countries were misleading, unless qualified by a proper understanding of<br>
the relative values of the several currencies and other relevant factors,<br>
including the level of indirect taxation, such as customs and excise duties,<br>
the level of social services expenditure, the standard of living in each<br>

of twelve months on the basis of licences in force on 30th June, 1945. This<br>
was a further continuation of an arrangement approved in May, 1944.<br>

SOCIAL SECURITY.<br>
TUBERCULOSIS PATIENTS-COMMONWEALTH GRANT.<br>
On 2nd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br>
The Tuberculosis Act, passed by Parliament in October, 1945, came<br>
into operation on 1st January, 1946, and provided for Commonwealth<br>
grants for diagnostic facilities, after-care facilities, payment for patients in<br>
State hospitals and special allowances to a sufferer or his or her dependants.<br>
In regard to special allowances, the then Minister for Health ( Senator Fraser)<br>
and I were directed by Cabinet to discuss with the State Ministers for Health<br>
the question of the States distributing, on behalf of the Commonwealth,<br>
the grant to be used as a special tubercul,) sis allowance.<br>
To provide for policy and administrative questions arising from the<br>
Act, Cabilnet to-dav decided that the Act be amended to provide that an<br>
amount of œ 250,000 a year may be payable to States, the allocation to each<br>
State to be determined by the Minister, on condition that the States distribute<br>
the grant to or in respect of sufferers from tuberculosis or their<br>
dependants in necessitous circumstances to achieve the object of encouraging<br>
sufferers to cease work and take treatment; to assist in preventing the<br>
spread of the disese and to promote the better treatment of the disease;<br>
and that payments received by individuals in accordance with the proposed<br>
new section shall not be regarded as income for the purposes of the Invalid<br>
and Old-age Pensions Act and of the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits<br>
Act. This will ensure that the tuberculosis special allowances are-excluded<br>
from the means tests imposed in these two Acts, thus making the allowances<br>
additional to any benefit the sufferer may be eligible to receive direct<br>
from the Commonweilth by waY of sickness benefit or invalid pension.""'<br>

On 3rd July, 1946, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron) announced<br>
that the Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee had recommended that<br>

The Government had adopted the recommendation and broadcasting stations<br>
had been requested to refrain forthwith from broadcasting such talks. </p>

PRICES.<br>
U. S. REVOCATION-EFFECT ON AUSTRALIA.<br>
On 3rd July, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) said that<br>
the effect on Australian prices of the abandonment of price control in the<br>
United States would depend on the. extent and direction of the inflationary<br>
forces in America. It was not known whether American exports would be<br>
affected or whether any increase in price would be significant. In any<br>
case, it would be some months before goods purchased at currnat or future<br>
prices would be landing in Australia and there was no present indication<br>
that the local retail price level would be affected. It was difficult to make<br>
any forecasts but Australia would watch developments in the United States<br>
with great interest both from the point of view of the lesson to be learned<br>
from the experiment, and the effects on the Australian economy.<br>

MEAT AGREEMENT.<br>
EXPORTS-CONTROL, BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Parliament.-On 3rd July, 1946, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr.<br>
Scully) introduced the Meat Export Control Bill. Mr. Scully said-<br>
The purpose of this bill, to amend the Meat Export Control Act, is to<br>
provide for the reconstitution of the Australian Meat Board, and to grant<br>
to the board additional powers necessary to enable it to carry out work in<br>
relation to the long-term purchase agreement covering ncat for export,<br>
entered into between the Commonw,. ealth Go-vernment and the British<br>
Government. The Australian Meat Board will consist of twelve members, including<br>
a Commonwealth Government representative, who will be appointed by the<br>
Governor-General. He will be employed full-time on the business of the<br>
board and will be chairman. Of the remaining eleven members, seven<br>
members, constituting a clear majority of the board, will be representative<br>
of producer interests. Producer members, comprising four representatives<br>
of the lamb and mutton producers, two of the beef producers, and one of'<br>
the pig producers, must be bona fide producers, and must be persons<br>
nominated by producer organizations constituted on a Commonwealth<br>
basis. Members appointed to represent the meat exporting companies arc<br>
to be appointed after consultation with representative organizations of<br>
meat exporters. The member appointed to represent the employees will<br>
be appointed after co:, ulltation with the Federal Council of the Meat<br>
Industry Employees Union. The member appointed to represent the<br>
publicly-owned abattoirs and freezing works will be appointed by th'e<br>
Governor-General. </p>
<p>J'I<br>
The bill gives the person presiding at a meeting tile right to dissent<br>
from any decision of the board. This right is necessary because of the<br>
Conmmn: nwealth Government's financial interest in the operations of thet<br>
board. It is essential that the chairman shall have the right to bring to<br>
thef Minister's notice immediately any resolutior which lie considers may<br>
involve the Commonwealth Government in any way on a point of principle<br>
or, on question of financial losses or gains.<br>
So that all sections of the industry may be in a position to present<br>
their views on matters affecting the ilndustry, provision has been made for<br>
th' settini. g-up of State conmmittees. It will be competent for any duly<br>
constituted State organization representing a section of the meat industry<br>
to: ; ppl\ fcr representation on the State committee.<br>
SAs the ainiistration of the long-term purchase agreement for meat<br>
between the Commonwealth Government and the British Government will<br>

provision has been malde for the powers of the board to be extended to<br>
includ the following<br>
To purchase on behalf of the Conimonwealth Government any meat, meat product,<br>
or edible offal.<br>
To sell on behalf of the Commonwealth Government any meat, meat product, or<br>

To manage and control as necessary, the handling, storage aifd shipment of any<br>

Subject to the approval of the Commonwealth Government, to obtain advances<br>
from the Commonwealth Bank under Commonwealth Government guarantee, for use<br>
in the purchase of meat for export and the payment of expenses incurred in connexion<br>
therewith. Attention is directed to the provision, of. special interest to producers,<br>
that. the colnitions attaching to the issue by the board of an export licence<br>

In Parliament.--On 3rd July, 1946, Mr. Scully introduced the Meat<br>
Industry Control Bill. Mr. Scully said<br>
The purpose of this bill. which is supplementary to the Meat Export<br>
Control Bill, is to transfer to the Australian Meat Board the powers arnd<br>
functions at present exercised by the Controller of Meat Supplies and the<br>
Meat Canning Committee under National Security Act regulations. It will<br>
b) e appreciated that the transfer is to be temporary, and that, with the<br>
expiration of the National Security Act, this act will cease to have the force<br>
of law. Notwithstanding that, the interests of the Commonwealth Government<br>
and of the meat industry, insofar as they relate to actions taken 1v<br>
the Controller of Meat Supplies and the Meat Canning Committee ander<br>
Nationa. l Secu-i ity Act regulations, must be protected. The bill provides<br>
that these rights and obligatilns shall be assumed by the Australian Meat<br>
Board. Since the rationing of meat and the control of meat prices n. re<br>
nmatters which, for the time being ; t least, are closely linked with the<br>
4420.--2 * i </p>
<p>general control of the meat industry, provision has been made for the temporary<br>
appointment to the Australian Meat Board of additional memhers,<br>
one to represent the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, and one the<br>
Director of Rationing. These members will automatically cease to hold<br>
office upon the expiration of the National Scc rity Act.""<br>

NATIONALITY.<br>
NATURALIZATION-NEW GUINEA.<br>
In Parliamnent.-On 4th July, 1946, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr.<br>
Calwell) introduced the Nationality Bill. Mr. Calwell said-<br>
Under existing nationality law, an essential requirement for the grant<br>
of a certificate of naturalization is that an applicant shall have resided for<br>
a prescribed period within the British dominions. The Territory of New<br>
Guinea does not form a part of the Briti., h dominions for the purposes of<br>
nationality law, and residence in the territory cannot be counted as<br>
residence for the grant of naturalization. This means that the only way<br>
open at present to a person living in the territory to acquire British nationality,<br>
which will be recognized in Australia, or other parts of the Empire,<br>
is to abandon his domicile there and take up residence in Australia or some<br>
other part of the British Commonwealth. The purpose of this bill is to<br>
enable a resident of the territory to qualify for naturalization as a British<br>
subject while maintaining his residence in the territory.<br>
Commonwealth Crown Law authorities have expressed the opinion<br>
that it is nQt possible to grant to residents of New Guinea naturalization<br>
which would be effective throughout the British dominions. The Government<br>
has decided that the next best should be given to residents of the<br>
territory; that is, that they shall be accorded the privilege of qualifying<br>
for the grant of British nationality which will have effect in the Commonwealth<br>
and its territories. The hill makes that provision.<br>
It is not the Government's intention that this shall be the final word<br>
on the subject. It is proposed to hold a conference of representatives of<br>
Britain and the Dominions in the near future to discuss certain nationality<br>
questions. It is intended to raise at that conference the matter of making<br>
provision that residence in New Guinea shall he regarded as a qualification<br>
for the grant of a certificate of naturalization which will be effective, not<br>
only in Australia and its territories, hut also throughout the whole of the<br>
British Commonwealth.' [ Th7e bill wlr pased.]<br>
JUDICIARY.<br>
ARBITRATION C. OURT-PENSION RIGHTS.<br>
In Ptli,, went.-On 4th July, 194i, the Minister for Labour ( Mr.<br>
Hollow iv) introduced the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration<br>
Bill. Mr. Holloway said<br>
The object of this hill is to provide that, where a judge of the Common-l<br>
weallth Arbitration Court has, before his appointment, served in any judicil<br>
dflir, und.' r a State, his service umnder the State. up to a period of ten yeo,' rs, </p>
<p>shall be deemed to be part of his service as a judge of the Commonwealth<br>
Arbitration Court for the purpose of calculating his pension rights. Under<br>
the act in its present form, account may be taken of prior service in a<br>
judicial office under the Commonwealth for the purposes of pension rights,<br>
hlt no such provision is made in respect of prior service in a judicial office<br>
under a State.<br>
In other legislation, for example, the BaInkraptry Act, a limited period<br>
of prior service in a judicial office under a State may be taken into account<br>
for the purposes of pension. The idea is to establish a permanent basis<br>
for settling matters of this kind. Recently, several new judges have been<br>
appointed, and most ce them have served in a judicial capacity in a State.""<br>
[ The bill was passed.]<br>
PATENTS.<br>
BILL INTRODUCED.<br>
In Pirliamein't.-On 4th July, 1946. the Acting Attorney-General ( Mr.<br>
IIllowa.) introduced the Patents Bill. MJr. Holloway said-<br>
The principal object of the bill is to remove certain disadvantages<br>
which have occurred by. reason of the deltayv at present existing in the<br>
examination work of the Patent Office. That delay has ibeen brought about<br>
in plart , y the fact that a large nmber of exaniiners of patent. s--representing<br>
over 60 per cent. of the stal'f-were released during the war fromn<br>
the Patent Office for service in the forces and in other departments. The<br>
de! ay has also been partly brought about by reason of an abnormal and<br>
entirely unpredictable increase of the number of applications for patents.<br>
This increase appears to be largely due to the great industrial development<br>
which has taken place in Australia in recent years. Many overseas manufacturers<br>
discovered during the war that the Australian market was worth-<br>
\ vhile. and that they cannot obtain royalties for the use of their inventions<br>
in Australia unless they patent them here. Tn 1939, the nunmb"" r of applications<br>
for patents was 5,700; last year it was 7,300; and it is expected<br>
that. this year the iiumbier will exceed 10,000.<br>
Every effort is being made to obtain the services of additional<br>
examinrs of patents. It takes at least three years to train an examiner<br>
full-in his work, and some considerable time will elapse before any substantial<br>
reduction is made of the arrears of examination work in the Patent<br>
Office. Anv serious delay in the examination of patent applications has a<br>
dlerimental effect on inventors, and -m industrial development.<br>
This bill proposes to amend, the law so as to provide for the publication<br>
complete specifications forthwith after lodgment at the Patent Office<br>
anld for a patentee whose invention has been used after publication to be<br>
entitled to damages for infringement committed from the date of publication<br>
forthwith after the lodgment instead of from the date of publication consequent<br>
upon acceptance. Damages are recoverable only if a patent is<br>
ultimnately sealed on the application and only in respect of valid claims.<br>
As a corollary to the provisions referred to, the bill gives protection to<br>
persons who may be threatened with infringement actions by applicants<br>
4420.--</p>
<p>on the basis of questionable or iivali I claims, and prohibits the miking of<br>
falso representations that articles are patented or the subject of ienlinr<br>
applications. SThe bill proposes to imake periai. neit a; practice aidopte! durig the<br>
war under ntional Security Act Regulations of not examiniung a pr, ov isiotial<br>

there should bie any public matters, requiring his personal attention, which<br>
necessitated his presence in Britain in the period concerned. He has now<br>
regretfully reached the conclusion that the decision recently announced to </p>
<p>summnioii the Peace Coaference at Paris onil 29th July, 1946, added to the<br>
other pressing problems which confront the British Government at present,<br>
render it impossible for hin to be absent froulnt Britain dluring the period<br>

SFollowing dibcussionts between the lMinister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br>
Evatt), the President of the United States ( Mr. Truman) andrl the Acting<br>

been completed betten the Australian and LniIod States Governments<br>
for the raising of the rank of their legations at Canluberra and Washington<br>
to embassies. and of the office of Minister to that of Ambas ador. This<br>
step is the natural consequence of the iicrea. ingly closer and cordial relations<br>
betweenll Australia and the Unitel States and reflects the added importance<br>
of the Pacific area in the eves of both goverimients. The move also serves<br>
as a recoanition of th. e major contribution made by Australia to victory<br>
in World War II., and of the important part which she continues to play<br>
in regari to the pireservation of security inii the Pacific.<br>

re-establishment. Arrangements had been made for a committee<br>
representative of the Ministry of Post-war Reconstruction, the Repatriation<br>
